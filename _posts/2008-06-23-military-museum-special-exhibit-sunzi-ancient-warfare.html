This was a special exhibit held between July 23 and October 5, 2008, at the Military (People's Liberation Army) Museum in Beijing. It features some of the best artifacts relating to warfare in ancient times. I also have two additional Military Museum photo albums dealing with Ancient Weapons and Warfare, and Modern Weapons.
