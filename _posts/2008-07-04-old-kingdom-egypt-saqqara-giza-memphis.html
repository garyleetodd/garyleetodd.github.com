<div class="gphoto-sidebar-subitem gphoto-sidebar-albumdesc">These are photos of ancient Egyptian sites dating from the 3rd &amp; 4th Dynasties of the Old Kingdom in Saqqara, Giza, &amp; Memphis. They were taken shortly after 9-11, which explains the delightful absence of droves of tourists. I have created separate albums for the Cairo Museum, Abu Simbel, &amp; other New Kingdom sites. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of History, Sias International University, Xinzheng, Henan, China. <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/GaryLeeTodd/EgyptOldKingdomSaqqaraGizaMemphis">http://picasaweb.google.com/GaryLeeTodd/EgyptOldKingdomSaqqaraGizaMemphis</a>#</div>
