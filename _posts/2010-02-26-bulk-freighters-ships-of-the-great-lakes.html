From 1975 to 1979 I lived in Duluth, Minnesota, overlooking the entrance to the Duluth Ship Canal. It was easy to photograph the ships entering the harbor. The Duluth photos were all taken from 1976 to 1979. The earliest photos were taken with a half-frame camera. The prints were not very good quality, so the digital copies are also not so good. I have added a few river barges, as well as English Channel and Rhine River shipping. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of History, Sias International University, Xinzheng, Henan, China.
