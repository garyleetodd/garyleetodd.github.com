On Dec. 6, 2008, I took half of these photos of a special exhibit at the Henan Provincial Museum in Zhengzhou. These were of all new artifacts heretofore unphotographed by me. The remainder I took May 2, 2009. The exhibit had been greatly changed, with some of the museum's greatest treasures added. Some of the later photos are of objects which may also be seen in two earlier Henan Provincial Museum albums on my website. In early 2010 I added 4 new albums to my website taken from the museum after renovation. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of History, Sias International University, Xinzheng, Henan, China.
