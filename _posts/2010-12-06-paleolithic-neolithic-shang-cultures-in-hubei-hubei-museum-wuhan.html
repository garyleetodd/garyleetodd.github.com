We start with the Paleolithic culture of Yunxian Man, although I am highly doubtful of what anthropologists claim about early human history. Next we have the exhibit of the Neolithic culture of Qujialing. We end with the Shang Dynasty culture of Panlongcheng, which confirms that the Shang culture of Yin (Anyang) of the Central Plains reached all the way south to the Yangtze Valley. This is one of 7 albums I've created for this provincial museum. Photos by Gary L.
