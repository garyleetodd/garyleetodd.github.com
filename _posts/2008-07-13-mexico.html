<div class="gphoto-sidebar-subitem gphoto-sidebar-albumdesc">Most of my Mexican photos were taken in archaeological sites and are filed in my Ancient Mesoamerican albums, or in the album from the INAH Museum in Mexico City. These are the remaining photos that are not of precolumbian artifacts. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of History, Sias International University, Xinzheng, Henan, China. <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/GaryLeeTodd/Mexico">http://picasaweb.google.com/GaryLeeTodd/Mexico</a>#</div>
