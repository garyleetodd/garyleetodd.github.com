<div class="gphoto-sidebar-subitem gphoto-sidebar-albumdesc">Henry Ford collected all sorts of things: automobiles, airplanes, household appliances, industrial machines, houses &amp; buildings. He admired Thomas Edison and had Edison's entire Menlo Park laboratory shipped to Michigan. The museum displays some of Ford's collections, while Greenfield Village is made up of buildings he had shipped there from all over America and England. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of History, Sias International University, Xinzheng, Henan, China. <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/GaryLeeTodd/HenryFordMuseumGreenfieldVillage">http://picasaweb.google.com/GaryLeeTodd/HenryFordMuseumGreenfieldVillage</a>#</div>
