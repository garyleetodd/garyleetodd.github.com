This album contains two galleries - the Gallery of Minority Peoples and the Gallery of Ming &amp; Qing Furniture. I took them just before closing, so they are not complete and I didn't get the labels. But at least you can get the general idea. This is one of at least six albums I've created for the different galleries of the museum. Check the "Shanghai" tag to find the others, or look for postings from August, 2008. Photos by Gary L.
