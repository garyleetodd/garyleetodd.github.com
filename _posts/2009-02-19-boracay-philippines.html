Boracay's white sand beach has been rated as one of the best beaches in the world. Most people get there by flying to Caticlan and taking a small ferry to Boracay Island. We circled the island about ten times while waiting to land; hence, the nice aerial views. We also took a catamaran to nearby Crystal Cove and all around Boracay, with several stops for snorkling at coral reefs. Photos by Gary L.
