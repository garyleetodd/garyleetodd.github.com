The National Museum in Beijing opened in March, 2011, after 5 years of renovation. I have 4 albums of photos taken April 7, but the majority of the exhibits were not yet open. This one is an exhibit of porcelain. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of History, Sias International University, Xinzheng, Henan, China.Â <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/GaryLeeTodd/NationalMuseumBeijingPorcelainExhibit#">https://picasaweb.google.com/GaryLeeTodd/NationalMuseumBeijingPorcelainExhibit#</a>
