Communism in China today is as scarce as hen's teeth. The free market has totally transformed China, leaving only symbols of the past. The closest thing to communism I have found is the Nanjie Commune in Henan Province. It is actually organized as on old-fashioned commune with each member receiving a nominal allowance, plus free food &amp; housing. A few members are engaged in agriculture, but most work in the commune's 20 or so industries, which produce beer, bricks, and a famous brand of noodles. Also tourism. People visit Nanjie to see a model commune in action, and also a quite attractive greenhouse exhibit. Photos by Gary L.
