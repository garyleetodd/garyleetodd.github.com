In the 1980s and early 90s I lived in Illinois, where there are many railroads. In my spare time I photographed quite a few of them. I am adding all my photos to my website in 5 different albums. This one is rolling stock of all sorts. I took almost all of these photos in 1987-90, mostly along the ICG mainline between the Champaign ICG Yard and Tolono. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of History, Sias International University, Xinzheng, Henan, China.Â <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/GaryLeeTodd/USARailroadsRollingStockOfTheLate1980s">https://picasaweb.google.com/GaryLeeTodd/USARailroadsRollingStockOfTheLate1980s</a>
