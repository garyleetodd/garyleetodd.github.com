This is a tomb of a Northern Wei emperor excavated at Luoyang. Nearby some 40 tombs from Henan Province have been reconstructed in a tomb museum. They span over a thousand years from Western Han through N. Song dynasties. The artifacts displayed inside the tombs, of course, are reproductions. Photos by Gary L.
