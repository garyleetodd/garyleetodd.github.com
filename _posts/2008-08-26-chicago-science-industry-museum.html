<div class="gphoto-sidebar-subitem gphoto-sidebar-albumdesc">This museum features the U-505, the only German U-boat captured during World War II. I also have some historic locomotives here, but so far have not been able to locate the rest of my photos from the museum. I will add them if and when I do. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of History, Sias International University, Xinzheng, Henan, China. <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/GaryLeeTodd/ChicagoScienceIndustryMuseum">http://picasaweb.google.com/GaryLeeTodd/ChicagoScienceIndustryMuseum</a>#</div>
