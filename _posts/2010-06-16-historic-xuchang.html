Xuchang has a long history and played a prominent role in the Three Kingdoms era, serving as the de facto capital of Cao Cao after 196 AD, and capital of the state of Wei in 220 until the capital was moved to Luoyang in the 220s. Baling Qiao is the site of the bridge where the great general Guan Yu bade farewell to the Prime Minister Cao Cao. He is honored with a temple there. Guan Yu resided at Chunqiu Lou where he studied the Spring &amp; Autumn Annals of Confucius. The Wenming Temple Pagoda dates to the Ming Dynasty and stands 52 meters tall.Â Photos by Gary L.
