Random photos of mostly ancient and medieval places in England from several different visits, in 1993, 2000, and 2003. British Museum photos &amp; other London museums are in separate category under World Museums. Many of these are poor quality copies of slides which I intend to fix this summer (2011) and replace then.Â Photos by Gary L.
