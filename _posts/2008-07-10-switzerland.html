Random photos of places in Switzerland, mostly around Lake Luzern (Lucerne), taken in 1993, 2000, or 2001. These are copies of slides I took before I got a good digital camera, but I plan to make better copies this summer (2011) and replace all these. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of History, Sias International University, Xinzheng, China. <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/GaryLeeTodd/Switzerland#">https://picasaweb.google.com/GaryLeeTodd/Switzerland#</a>
