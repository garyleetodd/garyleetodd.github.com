This is my fourth world's fair (I have photos from the other 3 posted elsewhere on my website). I'll let the pictures speak for themselves. I was there for only one day, so there is quite a bit I did not get to see or photograph. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of History, Sias International University, Xinzheng, Henan, China. <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/GaryLeeTodd/ShanghaiExpo2010WorldSFair#">http://picasaweb.google.com/GaryLeeTodd/ShanghaiExpo2010WorldSFair#</a>
