This is a May, 2009, visit to Yuntai Mountain. You can see photos from a 2005 visit included in my "Mountains of Central China" album. The antique autos were in a restaurant inside the mountain park. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of History, Sias International University, Xinzheng, China. <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/GaryLeeTodd/YuntaishanWorldGeoPark">http://picasaweb.google.com/GaryLeeTodd/YuntaishanWorldGeoPark</a>#
