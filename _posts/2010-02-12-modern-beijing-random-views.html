I have many other albums of historic Beijing. This album is made up mostly of modern parts of Beijing which don't fit in any of my other categories. Beijing is an incredible city, and these photos hardly do it justice. I got the train photos while stranded on the remnants of the Ming Dynasty City Wall waiting out the rain. China has an excellent railway system. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of History, Sias International University, Xinzheng, Henan, China. <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/GaryLeeTodd/ModernBeijingRandomViews">http://picasaweb.google.com/GaryLeeTodd/ModernBeijingRandomViews</a>#
