Sias University began in 1998. By 2010-2011 it had over 22,000 students, 14 classroom buildings, a dozen dormitories, a large indoor pool, and has been acclaimed one of the 10 most beautiful campuses in China. The pagoda sits atop the "tomb of the fisherman," dating back to the Warring States period over 2000 years ago. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of American &amp; Chinese History at Sias.
