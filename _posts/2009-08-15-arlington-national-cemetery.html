This is the United States National Cemetery at Arlington, Virginia, located just across the Potomac River from Washington, D.C., on land stolen from the Robert E. Lee family during the War Between the States. The Washington, D.C. photos are listed in a separate album under United States Historic Sites. The Smithsonian Institution photos are in six separate albums listed under United States Museums. Unless otherwise noted, the photos were taken in July, 2009. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of History, Sias International University, Xinzheng, Henan, China.
