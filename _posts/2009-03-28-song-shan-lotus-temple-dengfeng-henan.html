On 3-28-2009 a group of foreign &amp; Chinese teachers from Sias University took a hike over Song Shan mountain near Shaolin Temple in Dengfeng. This was a real hike over goat trails - not the typical tourist mountain "hike" over paved walkways and stairs. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of History, Sias International University, Xinzheng, Henan, China. <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/GaryLeeTodd/SongShanLotusTempleDengfengHenan">http://picasaweb.google.com/GaryLeeTodd/SongShanLotusTempleDengfengHenan</a>#
