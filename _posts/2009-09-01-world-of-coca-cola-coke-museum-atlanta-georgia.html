This is a little different from the museums I typically photograph. Coca-Cola was invented in Atlanta, Georgia, and that is where I lived before going to China. Lots of these photos have my wife Amy in them. I took them in summer of 2009. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of History, Sias International University, Xinzheng, China. <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/GaryLeeTodd/WorldOfCocaColaCokeMuseumAtlantaGeorgia#">https://picasaweb.google.com/GaryLeeTodd/WorldOfCocaColaCokeMuseumAtlantaGeorgia#</a>
