Shanshan was a commercial center near Nanyang where merchants from neighboring provinces exchanged goods and worshiped the god of business (Guan Yu). It was built in the mid-18th century and operated throughout much of the Qing Dynasty. Most of the amazing architecture is original. Photos by Gary L.
