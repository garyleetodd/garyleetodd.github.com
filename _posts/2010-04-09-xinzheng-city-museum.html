Xinzheng (where I have been living the last 5 years) is the birthplace of Huangdi and the type site for the Peiligang Culture. The artifacts from the tomb of the King of Zheng, discovered in 1923, formed the basis for the Henan Provincial Museum in Zhengzhou, and led to the birth of both modern Chinese museums &amp; modern Chinese archaeology. The bronze in this museum is all Eastern Zhou. The stone &amp; pottery which I labelled Neolithic is probably Peiligang Culture, and perhaps Yangshao, but I forgot to check the labels. I have additional albums featuring Xinzheng historic sites and the Henan Provincial Museum. Photos by Gary L.
