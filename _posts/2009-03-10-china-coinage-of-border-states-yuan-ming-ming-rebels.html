These coins from my personal collection follow the Southern Song and continue up to the Qing Dynasty. The "S" number refers to the number in the Schjoth standard catalog of Chinese coinage. This is followed by the dynasty, the emperor who issued the coin, his reign date, and sometimes the particular reign title era in which the coin was issued. Photos by Gary L.
