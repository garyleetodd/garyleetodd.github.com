My grandfather, Cecil Amos Todd, was born in Red House, West Virginia, in 1890. I've included photos I took in Red House many years ago, plus a 1947 family photo I copied. James Todd, my great-great-great-great grandfather, was one of the Virginia Militia who fought at Point Pleasant, and whose name appears on the monument. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of History, Sias International University, Xinzheng, Henan, China. <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/GaryLeeTodd/WestVirginiaBattleOfPointPleasantToddRoots#">http://picasaweb.google.com/GaryLeeTodd/WestVirginiaBattleOfPointPleasantToddRoots#</a>
