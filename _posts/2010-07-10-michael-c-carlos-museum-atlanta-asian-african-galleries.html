The Michael C. Carlos Museum is housed at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia. It has 5 main galleries of ancient artifacts which I have photographed and placed into 4 albums on my website. Three are from July, 2009; the fourth was added July, 2010. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of History, Sias International University, Xinzheng, Henan, China. <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/GaryLeeTodd/MichaelCCarlosMuseumAtlantaAsianAfricanGalleries#">http://picasaweb.google.com/GaryLeeTodd/MichaelCCarlosMuseumAtlantaAsianAfricanGalleries#</a>
