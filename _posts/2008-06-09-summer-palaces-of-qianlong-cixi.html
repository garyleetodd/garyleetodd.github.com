The Summer Palace was designed by Jesuits to look like the great European palaces. It was built by Emperor Qianlong (1736-1795) and destroyed by the British &amp; French in 1860 during the Second Opium War. The ruins were left in place as a reminder of western imperialism. During the regency of Empress Dowager Cixi in the late 19th century, portions around Lake Kunming were repaired and used by members of the court. The infamous Marble Pavilion was repaired with funds which had been set aside to build a modern navy, and contributed to defeat in 1894-95 at the hands of Japan. Contrary to popular belief, Cixi was more a figurehead than the evil power behind the throne. Highlights of the Summer Palace include the Marble Pavilion, Temple of the Fragrance of Buddha and the Long Corridor. Photos by Gary L.
