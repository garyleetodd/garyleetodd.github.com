Chichen Itza &amp; Uxmal, in the northern Yucatan, were the two greatest Maya sites of the Post-Classic era. The temple of Kukulcan (probably Mayan for Quetzalcoatl) at Chichen Itza is perhaps the most famous pyramid in America. Historical records are generally lacking, but architecture is among the finest in ancient Mesoamerica. I took the Chichen photos in winter 2001 and the Uxmal photos one year later. Photos by Gary L.
