This exhibit features porcelain from the Han Dynasty (and earlier) through the reign of the last Qing emperor. The earliest examples are excavated; the more recent ones come from collections handed down over the centuries. It is one of 7 albums I've created for this provincial museum. Photos by Gary L.
