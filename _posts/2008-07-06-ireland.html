Random photos of historic &amp; scenic places in Ireland, taken in 2003. I will make better copies of these photos this summer (2011) and replace them at that time.Â Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of History, Sias International University, Xinzheng, Henan, China. <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/GaryLeeTodd/Ireland#">https://picasaweb.google.com/GaryLeeTodd/Ireland#</a>
