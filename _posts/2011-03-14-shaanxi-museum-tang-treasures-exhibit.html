This is a special exhibit of a hoard of Tang Dynasty treasures displayed at the Shaanxi Provincial Museum in March, 2011. I have 5 earlier albums from this museum. Some of these artifacts can be found in my Tang Gallery album from 2009, and may even be better photos because the harsh lighting in this exhibit made it difficult to get good images.
