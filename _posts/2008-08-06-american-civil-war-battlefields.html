By definition there was no "Civil War" in America. A civil war is when two sides fight for control of one country. Historically accurate terms include War Between the States, War for Southern Independence, or War of Northern Aggression. As usual, the winners wrote the history, and in this case, named the conflict. I have photographed numerous battlefields, and added a few photos of other historically-relavant places like capitol buildings, homes of leading personalities, tombs, monuments, and museums.
