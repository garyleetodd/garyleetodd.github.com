This is another great museum which I visited many times before I started seriously taking photos. Someday I hope to return and do some serious picture-taking there. In the meantime, I am posting all that I have. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of History, Sias International University, Xinzheng, Henan, China. <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/GaryLeeTodd/FieldMuseumOfNaturalHistory">http://picasaweb.google.com/GaryLeeTodd/FieldMuseumOfNaturalHistory</a>#
