Duke Lu (Zhu Yuliu), 1568-1614, was the only full brother of the Ming Emperor Wanli. His tomb near Xinxiang is the only Ming royal tomb in Henan Province. His Imperial Concubine Zhao's tomb is next to his. Most Ming tombs are near Beijing, except for the tomb of Hongwu in Nanjing. Dingling, the tomb of Duke Lu's brother, Emperor Wanli, is the only one open to the public in Beijing. Photos by Gary L.
