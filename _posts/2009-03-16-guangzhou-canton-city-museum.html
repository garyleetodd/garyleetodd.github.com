Guangzhou City Museum, housed in the Zhenhai Tower in Yuexiu Park, traces the history of the Guangzhou (Canton) area from neolithic settlement through the Qing Dynasty. Nearby is the Tomb of the King of Yue Museum. Poor lighting &amp; long exposure time left some of these images blurred. My apologies. Photos by Gary L.
