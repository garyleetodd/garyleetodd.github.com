Hunan Provincial Museum has a great collection of ancient Shang and Western Zhou bronzes. One gallery features the ten greatest archaeological discoveries of Hunan Province, several of which are among the greatest discoveries in the world. The museum's greatest treasures are the over 3000 cultural artifacts excavated from the three Mawangdui Tombs of the Han Dynasty. Because it its great significance, I have placed this gallery in a separate album. Photos by Gary L.
