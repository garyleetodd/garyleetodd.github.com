Kunming was the home of the ancient Dian Culture which produced unique and spectacular bronze artifacts, some of which are displayed here. The bulk of the Dian bronzes are in the Yunnan Provincial Museum. The City Museum also has skeletons of some of Yunnan's rare and unusual dinosaurs, as well as a sutra pillar and tomb markers from a Dali Kingdom temple of the Song Dynasty era which once stood on the museum site.
