Anyang was the site of the last Shang (Yin) capital, for some 255 years. In 1899 the famous oracle bones were discovered there, confirming the historicity of the last 9 of the Shang kings. Fu Hao, the consort of King Wu Ding, was buried there c. 1200 BC. She is considered China's first female general, and her tomb is the only intact Shang royal tomb discovered so far. Objects in the tomb are reproductions, but the artifacts shown in the on-site museum are all genuine. Other artifacts from Fu Hao are found in my albums from the Henan Provincial Museum in Zhengzhou or the National Museum in Beijing. The chariot burials are the earliest discovered in China. One can see the evidence for human sacrifice in many of these pictures. I have posted another album featuring the 10th century pagoda in downtown Anyang. Photos by Gary L.
