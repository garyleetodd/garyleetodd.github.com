Col. Robert R. McCormick was publisher of the Chicago Tribune Newspaper. During World War I he served as a colonel in the First Army Division, the "Big Red One." He named his Wheaton, Illinois, estate Cantigny after the village in France where his division saw much action. He built a museum depicting the history of the First Army Division and created a foundation to make the museum &amp; estate free to the public after his death. Photos by Gary L.
