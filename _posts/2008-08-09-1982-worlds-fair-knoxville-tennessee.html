<div class="gphoto-sidebar-subitem gphoto-sidebar-albumdesc">This was the first time that "Red China" exhibited in a World's Fair, and its pavilion was arguably the highlight of the fair. I've been told the terracotta warriors from the tomb of Qin Shihuang were, in fact, reproductions, but the rest of the craftsmanship exhibited there was outstanding. The display of circus miniatures was pretty impressive as well. Overall, the 1964-65 New York World's Fair and Expo 67 in Montreal were bigger and more impressive. I have recently added a new album of B&amp;W photos from those fairs. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of History, Sias International University, Xinzheng, Henan, China. <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/GaryLeeTodd/1982WorldSFairKnoxvilleTennessee">http://picasaweb.google.com/GaryLeeTodd/1982WorldSFairKnoxvilleTennessee</a>#</div>
