This is the museum with most of the great national treasures. Unfortunately, it has been under renovation for the last several years, and is not scheduled to open until 2010. These photos are from a small temporary exhibit they had there in 2006, along with the wax museum in the same complex. When the museum reopens I intend to make significant additions to this album.
