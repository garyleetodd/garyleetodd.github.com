This memorial commemorates the 300,000 or so victims of a 6-week rampage by invading Japanese troops in Nanjing in 1937. Iris Chang's, <em>The Rape of Nanking</em>, is an excellent popular account of this forgotten holocaust of WWII. The museum contains many photos which have been published elsewhere, so I did not copy them here. But I have strong sympathies for the Chinese victims of this brutality, as members of my own mother's family perished in the Nazi holocaust at Auschwitz. As with the Nanjing Massacre, there is a company of fools who try to deny that this mass murder ever happened. Â Photos by Gary L.
