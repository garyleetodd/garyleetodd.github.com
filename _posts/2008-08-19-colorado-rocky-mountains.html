<div class="gphoto-sidebar-subitem gphoto-sidebar-albumdesc">These are mostly scenic photos of the Colorado Rockies. In the 1970s I worked sometimes at a camp (Bear Trap Ranch) in the mountains near Colorado Springs. Cripple Creek and Victor were old gold mining towns at a fairly high elevation (nearly 3 km). Garden of the Gods has some pretty amazing rock formations. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of History, Sias International University, Xinzheng, Henan, China. <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/GaryLeeTodd/ColoradoRockyMountains">http://picasaweb.google.com/GaryLeeTodd/ColoradoRockyMountains</a>#</div>
