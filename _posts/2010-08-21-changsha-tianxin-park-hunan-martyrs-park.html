Tianxin Park contains the only remaining part of the old city wall, and was the site of fighting during the Taiping Uprising. Hunan Martyr's Park, on Lake Nianjia, is dedicated to those who died in the struggle to free China from foreign aggressors. The city zoo is located next to the park. Photos by Gary L.
