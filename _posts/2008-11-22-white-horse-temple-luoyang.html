White Horse Temple (Baima si) is where tradition says Buddhism first took root in China in the first century with sacred texts brought from India on two white horses. At that time Luoyang was capital of the Eastern or Latter Han Dynasty. Unfortunately, the pagoda was under repair when I visited on November 22, 2008, and was still under repair in June, 2010. I have included two photos from an earlier visit in 2006. Photos by Gary L.
