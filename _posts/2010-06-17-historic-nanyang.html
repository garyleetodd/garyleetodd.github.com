Nanyang is a beautiful modern city in southern Henan with a rich history. Historic sites featured in this album include: Wolong Hill, where Zhuge Liang farmed the land and Liu Bei visited him three times entreating him to serve as his military advisor at the end of the Eastern Han Dynasty; an ancient prefectural administrative office first built in 1271, which served as the site of local government during the Yuan, Ming, &amp; Qing Dynasties, the Republican Era, and up to the beginning of the People's Republic of China; the memorial hall of the sage of medicine; and Wang Fu Shan, the rockery and temple belonging to the palace of the 23rd son of the first Ming emperor, Zhu Yuanzhang (Hongwu).
