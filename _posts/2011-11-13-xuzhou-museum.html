Xuzhou City Museum has many of the treasures from two Han tombs in Xuzhou, Jiangsu Province. I photographed the tomb and terracotta army of Liu Wu, King of Chu, and have posted this in a separate album. The museum contains the original jade burial suits from the tomb, as well as many other - mostly Han Dynasty - artifacts from Xuzhou. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of History, Sias International University, Xinzheng, Henan, China.Â <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/116512474184071531500/XuzhouMuseum">https://picasaweb.google.com/116512474184071531500/XuzhouMuseum</a>
