This is my personal collection of Chinese artifacts: mostly ancient bronze weapons, mirrors, chariot parts, belthooks, and coins. I've included a few artifacts from other ancient cultures of interest to me. These are mostly common artifacts rather than the national treasures prominently displayed in museums and books. I have 5 more albums dealing with coins. Photos by Gary L.
