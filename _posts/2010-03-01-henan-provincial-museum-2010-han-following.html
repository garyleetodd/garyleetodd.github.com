The museum has been totally renovated, with many new artifacts and labels in English. It's definitely raised the standards for Chinese museums. I've included the museum labels at the beginning of each gallery &amp; each exhibit. In addition to 8 museum albums from 2010, I have 3 earlier albums from this museum. Photos by Gary L.
