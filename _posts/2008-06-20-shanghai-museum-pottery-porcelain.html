This album contains nearly every artifact which was on display at the Shanghai Museum Pottery Gallery on August 23-24, 2008. This is definitely the most thorough collection of Chinese pottery I have ever seen. This is one of four albums I've created for some 1250 artifacts I photographed in the museum. Photos by Gary L.
