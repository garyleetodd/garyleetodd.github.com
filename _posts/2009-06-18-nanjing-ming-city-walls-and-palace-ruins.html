Nanjing has a long and fascinating history, some of which is showcased in this and several other Nanjing photo albums on my website. When Zhu Yuanzhang (Emperor Hongwu, 1368-1398) established the Ming Dynasty, he made Nanjing his capital, built the city walls shown here, and built a palace which was later destroyed. The view of Xuanwu Lake Park was taken from the pagoda at Jiming Temple. Photos by Gary L.
