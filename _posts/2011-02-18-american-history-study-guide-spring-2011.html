</ul>
Political Parties

	<li>Developed in response to desires of people</li>
	<li>2 parties today</li>
	<li>Minor parties exist, but not normally important</li>
</ul>
Democratic Party
<ul>
	<li>Oldest of America’s two major parties</li>
	<li>Was the conservative party in 19<sup>th</sup> century</li>
	<li>Effectively removed conservatives by 1970s</li>
	<li>Promotes liberal social programs like food stamps, cash payments to mothers, subsidized housing &amp; medical care</li>
	<li>Promotes big government &amp; high taxes</li>
	<li>Controls all government education (public schools &amp; universities)</li>
	<li>Controls most of media</li>
	<li>Claims to be party of common man but is party of Hollywood elite &amp; majority of rich</li>

</ul>
Republican Party
<ul>

	<li>Became conservative party in 20<sup>th</sup> century</li>
	<li>Traditional belief in limited government, individual responsibility, low taxes, strong national defense, tough policy against crime</li>
	<li>Falsely labeled as party of rich, but under Reagan became popular with working people</li>
	<li>Strong appeal to thinking people &amp; tendency to practice reasoned debate</li>
	<li>In recent years the two parties have tended to adopt similar practices &amp; beliefs</li>
</ul>
America’s Political Parties
<ul>
	<li>Politicians receive high salaries, excellent retirement benefits, &amp; many other advantages</li>
	<li>Congress is exempt from Social Security it forces all other people to pay for</li>
	<li>Goal of most politicians of both parties is to get elected and keep getting re-elected</li>
</ul>
Principle of Federalism: American government operates at different levels

Each state has its own government

United States Economy
<ul>
	<li>Large land mass &amp; good climate</li>
	<li>Abundant natural resources</li>
	<li>Relatively small population</li>
	<li>Protestant Work Ethic &amp; an economic system which rewards hard work &amp; thrift</li>
	<li>(last point may be questioned today, but it was true in the past when America was becoming a world superpower)</li>
</ul>
Economic System:

Capitalism (free enterprise, market economy, or supply side economics)
<ul>
	<li>Private ownership of property a fundamental right</li>
	<li>Based on ideas in Adam Smith, <em>The Wealth of Nations</em>, 1776</li>
	<li>In practice, a mixed economy with elements of capitalism &amp; socialism</li>
	<li>Similar to Britain (and China)</li>
	<li>Underlying principle of capitalism: Entrepreneurs pursuing self-interest benefit everyone</li>
	<li>Example of Bill Gates</li>
	<li>Today, a <em>mixed economy</em>, with elements of capitalism &amp; socialism</li>
	<li></li>
</ul>
<em>Laissez-faire</em> (government does not interfere in economy):
<ul>
	<li>Thomas Jefferson: “That government is best which governs least.”</li>
	<li>Traditional American value still taught in school</li>
	<li>American history has witnessed continuous growth of government and gradual loss of freedoms</li>
</ul>
American Industry
<ul>
	<li>Much of America’s wealth is due to the fact the U.S. avoided the destruction of two world wars</li>
	<li>The problem is that America continued to use factories built in the 19<sup>th</sup> century</li>
	<li>Nations destroyed in WWII were able to rebuild with new, modern factories</li>
</ul>
Types of Businesses:

Proprietorships
<ul>
	<li>Owned by individual or family</li>
	<li>Owner liable (responsible) for all debts</li>
	<li>Today about 17 million proprietorships</li>
</ul>
Partnerships
<ul>
	<li>Owned by small number of people</li>
	<li>Risk and profits are shared</li>
	<li>Today about 16 million partnerships</li>
	<li>Proprietorships &amp; partnerships are called “small businesses”</li>
	<li>Both types are popular with people who want to “be their own boss”</li>
</ul>
Corporations
<ul>
	<li>Usually called big business</li>
	<li>About 2% of all business, but 90% of all business income</li>
	<li>Many investors (owners of stock)</li>
	<li>Liability limited to value of stock</li>
</ul>
Role of Government in Business:
<ul>
	<li>Almost none in 19th century (<em>laissez-faire</em>)</li>
	<li>Today the government</li>
	<li>- protects rights of workers</li>
	<li>- protects consumers</li>
	<li>- prevents monopolies</li>
	<li>- fights for American industry in world market</li>
	<li>In practice big business and allies in government pass laws &amp; taxes aimed at limiting competition by small businesses</li>
	<li>Example: minimum wage laws appear to try to help the poorest workers, but in fact they cost thousands of jobs of the least skilled and the young – such laws mainly buy the votes of workers who want to eliminate competition</li>
</ul>
<strong>Principal American Holidays</strong>

Christmas (December 25): celebrates birth of Jesus Christ (most important holiday)
<ul>
	<li>Celebrating Christmas was outlawed in 17<sup>th</sup> century Massachusetts because it is not found in the Bible</li>

</ul>
<strong> </strong>

<strong>Lecture IV.  American Revolution, 1763-1783</strong>

<strong> </strong>

Colonial America, 1607-1775

¨  2 centuries of neglect allowed American colonies much freedom

¨  Democratic institutions slowly emerged

¨  Colonists grew increasingly critical of governors appointed by King

¨  1735: John Peter Zenger arrested for publishing article critical of Governor of New York

¨  Zenger tried for libel

¨  Defense attorney argued his writing was true &amp; he should be acquitted

¨  Colonial jury agreed &amp; acquitted Zenger

¨  Established principle that truth was a sufficient defense for libel (If it’s true, you can’t convict a person of libel.)

¨  Landmark trial in history of freedom of the press

<strong>More Underlying Problems</strong>

¨  Mercantilism: the theory that colonies exist for the benefit of the mother country

¨  Theory led to series of acts to benefit England at the expense of America

¨  British acts forbade colonies to manufacture iron, hats, &amp; molasses because they competed with the mother country

<strong>Navigation Acts</strong>

¨  British Navigation Acts required all goods shipped to England &amp; her colonies to be transported in English ships

¨  Acts required all shipments to go through England first, to provide jobs for British dockworkers &amp; to make it easier to tax

¨  Americans resisted British laws and became proficient smugglers

<strong>Conflicts Leading to Independence</strong>

¨  Threats to colonies: Spanish in Florida, Indians in the West, &amp; French in Canada &amp; the West

¨  Four colonial wars resulted

¨  French &amp; Indian War, 1754-1763, last and most important colonial war

<strong>1763: Treaty of Paris – British Empire doubled in size</strong>

<strong>Problems Resulting from French &amp; Indian War</strong>

¨  Large British debts from war

¨  Problem of defending colonies from French &amp; Indians

¨  1763: Pontiac’s Uprising – massacres on frontier

¨  British response: Proclamation of 1763 forbade colonists from going farther west

¨  Many investors angered because they owned land west of Proclamation Line

¨  British need for new revenue led to new taxes

¨  British stationed troops in colonies for defense – seen by colonists as threat to liberty

Sugar Act, 1764

¨  Tax on all sugar entering colonies

¨  Britain sent customs officers to collect taxes

¨  Ordered governors to enforce laws against smuggling

¨  Accused smugglers tried by judge rather than by jury

¨  British officials given power to search suspect’s house without search warrant

Stamp Act, 1765
<ul>
	<li>Tax on documents &amp; printed matter</li>
	<li>Radical opponents of Stamp Act organize as Sons of Liberty</li>
	<li>Sons of Liberty protest; boycott British goods; riot against stamp tax collectors &amp; destroy house of Massachusetts governor</li>
	<li>“No taxation without representation”</li>
	<li>Tax repealed</li>
</ul>
Boston Massacre
<ul>
	<li>March, 1770, Boston, Massachusetts</li>
	<li>Soldiers fire into crowd; kill 5</li>
	<li>Sons of Liberty claims British plot to destroy colonial liberty</li>

	<li>Colonial dockworkers angered by competition</li>
	<li>Drunken crowd attacks off-duty British soldiers</li>
	<li>Throw snowballs, excrement, bricks at British</li>
	<li>About 200 colonists against 20 British</li>
	<li>British disorganized; panicked; fired in fear</li>
	<li>Paul Revere drawing pure propaganda</li>
</ul>
Very effective propaganda: we still publish that picture today

Boston Tea Party, 1773

¨  New taxes led to new protests

¨  British repealed taxes, except tax on tea

¨  Price of tea actually lowered in effort to help East India Company

¨  Tea became symbol of British “tyranny”

¨  Sons of Liberty dressed as Indians boarded 3 British vessels in Boston Harbor &amp; destroyed tea in protest of “tyranny”

British response to Destruction of Tea:

¨  British responded with 4 Coercive Acts

¨  Port of Boston closed until colonists pay for tea

¨  Massachusetts legislature suspended

¨  British soldiers quartered in private buildings

¨  British soldiers accused of colonial crimes to be tried by home country, not in colony

¨  Unrelated act: Quebec Act organized Ohio River area, making it hard for New England to expand there

¨  Colonists call all 5 acts the “Intolerable” Acts

¨  Colonists saw Acts as plot to destroy colonial liberty

¨  First Continental Congress met in Philadelphia to plan strategy: formed first inter-colonial government

¨  Massachusetts legislature met illegally at Concord

Colonial Minutemen

<strong>Lecture VII.  War Between the States and Reconstruction</strong>

Principles of History:
<ul>
	<li>The winner of the war writes its history</li>
	<li>Winners are always right</li>
	<li>Winners always claim their cause is just</li>
	<li>Losers are always wrong</li>
	<li>Winners always make the losers look as bad as possible</li>
	<li>This is true of all nations, all cultures, and all time periods of history</li>
	<li>The North won the “Civil War”</li>
	<li>The North wrote its history</li>
	<li>The North gave the war the title “Civil War”</li>
	<li>By definition, there was no “civil war” in America</li>
	<li>A “civil war” is when two sides fight to control the country</li>
	<li>Historically correct terms include: War Between the States; War for Southern Independence; or War of Northern Aggression</li>
</ul>
Slavery
<ul>
	<li>Some people claim the war was about slavery</li>
	<li>This is partly true, but misleading</li>
	<li>Lincoln did not start the war to end slavery</li>
	<li>Lincoln promised to leave slavery alone to “die a natural death”</li>
	<li>Lincoln ended slavery only after he was losing &amp; needed support of the English</li>
	<li>Black African slavery has existed for over 2000 years</li>
	<li>Spanish imported African slaves long before English colonies did</li>
	<li>90% of all African slaves went to Latin America &amp; the Caribbean, not U.S.</li>
	<li>Northerners from New  England (not Southerners) transported all the slaves from Africa to America</li>
	<li>1619: 1st African slaves (20) in Jamestown</li>
	<li>Slaves were sold at auctions</li>
	<li>Slave marriages were not recognized</li>
	<li>Children of slaves became slaves</li>
	<li>American slavery was based on race</li>
	<li>Slaves were considered property with no legal rights</li>
	<li>Slaves were kidnapped in Africa by other African tribes and by Muslim slave traders, then sold to Yankee slave traders</li>
	<li>Most slaves were NOT physically abused; they were valuable property</li>
	<li>Average slave lived 9-10 years longer than the average free white worker in the North</li>
	<li>Average slave ate 900 calories of food per day more than the average free white worker in the North</li>
</ul>
Cotton gin
<ul>
	<li>Patented in 1793 by Eli Whitney</li>
	<li>Cotton gin made slavery more profitable</li>
	<li>1 slave could now do the work of 20</li>
	<li>Cotton became a valuable cash crop</li>
	<li>Southern plantations began to expand as a direct result of the cotton gin</li>
	<li>Slavery had been dying out before 1793</li>
	<li>Afterward it began to expand</li>
	<li>Southern economy became based on cotton</li>
</ul>
Southern slave-owners
<ul>
	<li>90% of all Southerners owned NO slaves</li>
	<li>Most slave-owners owned 5 or fewer slaves</li>
	<li>Fewer than 200 families owned gangs of 100 slaves or more, but these large plantation owners owned about ½ of all slaves</li>
	<li>Slaves in plantation gangs lived in separate slave quarters</li>
	<li>Other slaves shared the master’s house, ate with his family, and were usually considered as members of the family</li>
</ul>
Economic exploitation of the South
<ul>
	<li>Since the 1790s Northern capitalists taxed Southern planters to finance building of Northern factories</li>
	<li>90% of all taxes were paid by the South</li>
	<li>Northerners received most of the benefit of taxes on Southern agriculture</li>
	<li>Karl Marx correctly stated that a principal cause of the “Civil War” was economic oppression of the South by the North</li>
</ul>
Slave &amp; Free states
<ul>
	<li>Free   states: North; slavery outlawed</li>
	<li>Slave states: South; slavery legal &amp; vital to economy</li>
	<li>Equal numbers of each in Senate</li>
	<li>Missouri Compromise, 1820: Missouri slave state; Maine free state; preserved balance in Senate &amp; prevented conflict</li>
</ul>
Mexican War
<ul>
	<li>1848 treaty gave northern 1/3 of Mexico to U.S.: Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, California, Utah, &amp; more</li>
	<li>Mexican Cession became battleground in growing struggle between free &amp; slave states</li>
</ul>

</ul>
Warning
<ul>
	<li>It is too early to make fair &amp; adequate assessment of Bush Presidency</li>
	<li>Most sources not yet available to scholars</li>
	<li>Most opinions based on information provided by media</li>
	<li>Media mostly controlled by Democrats (enemies of Bush – 89% admitted they voted for Gore)</li>
</ul>
Barack Obama
<ul>
	<li>Bad economy always favors other party</li>
	<li>Obama elected for promise of “change”</li>
	<li>Seen by followers as a “savior”</li>
	<li>But a U.S. President does not have the power to save everything</li>
</ul>
The remaining lectures will deal with an overview of American history, major trends, problems, analysis and interpretations, and an assessment of the first 2 ½ years of the Obama Presidency. However, at the time I am posting this study guide, I have not fully prepared the PowerPoints for those lectures/discussions. I may or may not add them to the study guide, but they will not be used on the final examination. All questions for the final will be based on what is already posted here.
