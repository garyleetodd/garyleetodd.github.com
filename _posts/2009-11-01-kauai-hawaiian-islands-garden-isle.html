These photos were all taken on the "Garden Island" of Kauai, mostly showing beautiful scenery. Many were taken from a helicopter. Some of these sites should be familiar, as they were featured in a number of movies and television shows. I took the photos in 2000. I have additional albums for Oahu and Hawaii, the "Big Island." These albums show more historic places, and can be found in the United States Historic Sites category. Photos by Gary L.
