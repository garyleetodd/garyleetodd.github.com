In a departure from my usual historic photos, these are mainly scenic pictures of the southwest corner of South Dakota. Enjoy the rugged beauty. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Professor of History, Sias International University, Xinzheng, Henan, China. <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/GaryLeeTodd/MtRushmoreBadlandsOfSouthDakota">http://picasaweb.google.com/GaryLeeTodd/MtRushmoreBadlandsOfSouthDakota</a>#
