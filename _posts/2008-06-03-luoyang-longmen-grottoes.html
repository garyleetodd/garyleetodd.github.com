Longmen Grottoes consists of over 100,000 Buddhist images carved in caves during the Northern Dynasties, Sui Dynasty, &amp; Tang Dynasty, c. 500-900 AD. Highlight is the Grand Buddha Niche, of which the central figure represents Maitreya, the Buddha of the Future. It was commissioned by China's only female emperor, Wu Zetian, and supposedly is based on her physical features. Photos by Gary L.
