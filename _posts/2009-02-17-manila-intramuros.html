This is the old walled Spanish city dating back to the 16th century, which includes the Manila Cathedral and Fort Santiago. During the Pacific War it was the final stronghold of the Japanese forces and was badly damaged in the fighting for liberation. There is a small museum at the fort devoted to personal items of Dr. Jose Rizal.Â Photos by Gary L.
