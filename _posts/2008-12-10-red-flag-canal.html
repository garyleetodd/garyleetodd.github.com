Red Flag Canal is a man-made water project built during the 1960s to alleviate drought in Linzhou City and the border region between Henan and Hebei Provinces. The 1500-kilometre canal runs through the Taihang Mountains, in some places cut right into the rock face. The region now caters to tourists who may ride boats through tunnels which were cut for the canal. Photos by Gary L.
