Random photos shot in France in 1993 and 2000. These are not-very-good copies of slides, which I intend to replace this summer (2011) with much better ones. I have a separate album for the Louvre. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of History, Sias International University, Xinzheng, China. <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/GaryLeeTodd/France#">https://picasaweb.google.com/GaryLeeTodd/France#</a>
