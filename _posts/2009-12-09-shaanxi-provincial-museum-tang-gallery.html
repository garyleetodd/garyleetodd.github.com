This is the Tang Dynasty (and following) Gallery of the Shaanxi Provincial Museum in Xi'an, taken in fall, 2009, following major renovation. I have an earlier album of photos from this museum, and have posted further albums of the other galleries. These are all high-resolution photos taken with a 15+ megapixul Canon. Unfortunately, I ran out of time before I could write down the information on all the artifacts in this gallery, so after the buddha statues, I am doing a lot of guessing. Corrections are always welcomed. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of History, Sias International University, Xinzheng, Henan, China. <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/GaryLeeTodd/ShaanxiProvincialMuseumTangGallery">http://picasaweb.google.com/GaryLeeTodd/ShaanxiProvincialMuseumTangGallery</a>#
