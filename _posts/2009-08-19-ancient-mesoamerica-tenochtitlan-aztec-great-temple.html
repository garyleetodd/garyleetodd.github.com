Tenochtitlan was the capital of the Colhua Mexica (Aztecs) and was destroyed by Hernan Cortez &amp; his Tlaxcalan allies in 1521. The Templo Major (Great Temple) was the site of thousands of human sacrifices to the war god Huitzilopochtli and rain god Tlaloc. Buried for centuries, it was rediscovered in the 1980s. Other photos of Aztec artifacts are in my INAH Museum album. Photos by Gary L.
