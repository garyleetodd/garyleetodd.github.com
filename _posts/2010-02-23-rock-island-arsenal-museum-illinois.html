I took the Rock Island photos c. 1961 with a Brownie Bulls-eye camera &amp; 620 BW film. This is the John M. Browning Museum at Rock Island Arsenal in Illinois near the Mississippi River. The others were taken at various time &amp; various places. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of History, Sias International University, Xinzheng, Henan, China.Â <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/GaryLeeTodd/RockIslandArsenalMuseumTanksCannonsMilitaryExhibits#">https://picasaweb.google.com/GaryLeeTodd/RockIslandArsenalMuseumTanksCannonsMilitaryExhibits#</a>
