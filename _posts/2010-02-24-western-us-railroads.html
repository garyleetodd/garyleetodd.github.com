In the 1980s and early 90s I lived in Illinois, where there are many railroads. In my spare time I photographed quite a few of them. I am adding all my photos to my website in 5 different albums. This one is for the major Western railroads. All locations are in Illinois unless otherwise noted. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of History, Sias International University, Xinzheng, Henan, China.Â <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/GaryLeeTodd/WesternUSRailroads">https://picasaweb.google.com/GaryLeeTodd/WesternUSRailroads</a>
