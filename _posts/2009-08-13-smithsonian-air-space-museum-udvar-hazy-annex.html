These photos were all taken in 2009 unless otherwise noted. I took a few in the 1990s, in 1978, and in 1961, before the Air &amp; Space Museum was built. I have also included photos from the Udvar-Hazy Air &amp; Space Annex at Dulles Airport. Several photos are without labels. I would welcome correct information &amp; corrections. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of History, Sias International University, Xinzheng, Henan, China. <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/GaryLeeTodd/SmithsonianAirSpaceMuseumAndUdvarHazyAnnex">http://picasaweb.google.com/GaryLeeTodd/SmithsonianAirSpaceMuseumAndUdvarHazyAnnex</a>#
