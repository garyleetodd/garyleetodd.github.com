<div class="gphoto-sidebar-subitem gphoto-sidebar-albumdesc">Here are some ancient Egypt sites dating from the New Kingdom: Temple of Amun at Karnak, Luxor Temple, Temple of Queen Hatshepsut, and several tombs in the Valley of the Kings. I have created other albums for the Cairo Museum, Old Kingdom sites, and other New Kingdom sites. Photos by Gary L.
