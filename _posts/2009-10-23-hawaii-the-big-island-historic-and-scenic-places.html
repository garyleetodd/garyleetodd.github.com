These photos were all taken on the Big Island of Hawaii, mostly showing historic religious and political sites. I also have photos of a recent lava flow and up-close shots of whales. I took the photos in 2003. I have additional albums for Oahu and Kauai. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of History, Sias International University, Xinzheng, Henan, China. <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/GaryLeeTodd/HawaiiTheBigIslandHistoricAndScenicPlaces">http://picasaweb.google.com/GaryLeeTodd/HawaiiTheBigIslandHistoricAndScenicPlaces</a>#
