The siege of Vicksburg by Union General Grant and its surrender in 1863 was a turning point in the War Between the States. The battlefield photos follow the auto tour shown in the brochure photos at the front of this album. The USS Cairo was sunk in the Mississippi River, raised 102 years later, restored, and placed on display on the battlefield. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of History, Sias International University, Xinzheng, Henan, China. <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/GaryLeeTodd/VicksburgBattlefieldUSSCairoMuseum#">http://picasaweb.google.com/GaryLeeTodd/VicksburgBattlefieldUSSCairoMuseum#</a>
