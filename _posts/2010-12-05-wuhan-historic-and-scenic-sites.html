Wuhan, situated where the Han River joins the Chang Jiang (Yangtse), was originally 3 cities: Wuchang, Hankou, and Hanyang. I made 7 photo albums from the fabulous collection of the Hubei Provincial Museum, but have added this 8th album of several other historic and scenic places in the city. Most of the pictures are of historic Yellow Crane Tower, plus some from the Guiyuan Temple built in the early Qing Dynasty. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of History, Sias International University, Xinzheng, Henan, China. <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/GaryLeeTodd/WuhanHistoricAndScenicSites#">http://picasaweb.google.com/GaryLeeTodd/WuhanHistoricAndScenicSites#</a>
