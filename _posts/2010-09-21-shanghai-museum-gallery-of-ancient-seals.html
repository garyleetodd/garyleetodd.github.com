This album contains the gallery of ancient seals of the Shanghai Museum. Most of them are quite small, and are generally placed in chronological order. This is one of at least six albums I've created for the different galleries of the museum. Check the "Shanghai" tag to find the others, or look for postings from August, 2008. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of History, Sias International University, Xinzheng, Henan, China. <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/GaryLeeTodd/ShanghaiMuseumGalleryOfAncientSeals#">http://picasaweb.google.com/GaryLeeTodd/ShanghaiMuseumGalleryOfAncientSeals#</a>
