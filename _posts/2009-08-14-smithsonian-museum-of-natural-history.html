I've always been fascinated with dinosaurs, so this album tends to focus on them. Photos are from 2009, except for some I took in 1978 and have labelled as such. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of History, Sias International University, Xinzheng, Henan, China. <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/GaryLeeTodd/SmithsonianMuseumOfNaturalHistory">http://picasaweb.google.com/GaryLeeTodd/SmithsonianMuseumOfNaturalHistory</a>#
