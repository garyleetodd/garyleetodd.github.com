The Cairo Museum houses a tiny fraction of the ancient relics of Egypt, while millions of artifacts remain in the ground or lie rotting in warehouses. Nevertheless, this is one of the great museums of the world. I regret that I had very limited time there, and that my photos were taken on print and slide film and copied later. A new, modern museum is scheduled to open soon. Photos by Gary L.
