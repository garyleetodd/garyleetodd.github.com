Zijin Shan, or Purple Mountain, lies on the edge of Nanjing. It is the burial place of Sun Quan, the king of Wu during the 3rd century Three Kingdoms Period, and of Zhu Yuanzhang, the first Ming Emperor (Hongwu). It houses the mausoleum of Dr. Sun Zhongshan (Sun Yat-sen), founder of the Guomindong and of modern China, and Linggu Temple and Pagoda. Photos by Gary L.
