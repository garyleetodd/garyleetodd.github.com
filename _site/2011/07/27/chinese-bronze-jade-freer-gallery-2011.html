These 2 rooms of jade &amp; bronze in the Freer Gallery of the Smithsonian in Washington, D.C., were not here in 2009. They have such a large collection that they rotate it. The photos I took then are posted in a separate album labelled Chinese &amp; Asian Art. It can be located on the website under July 2009. These artifacts were mostly acquired from China during the Warlord Era (c. 1920s), and the bronzes were cleaned. We don't do that today with ancient bronze, but it does give a better idea of what they looked like when they were new. Photos by Gary L.
