The Bell &amp; Drum Towers of Xi'an date from early Ming Dynasty, and, along with the pair in Beijing, are the best-preserved bell &amp; drum towers in China. Both contain small museums, and offer musical performances at regular intervals. I have more photos of both posted in my earlier "Xi'an: Ancient Capital" album. Photos by Gary L.
