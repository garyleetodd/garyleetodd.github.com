The Xi'an City Museum is next to the Xiaoyan Pagoda and contains relics from when Xi'an was the capital of the W Zhou, Qin, W Han, Sui &amp; Tang dynasties. I first photographed it in spring, 2011, and returned to finish the job in October. Many bronzes and sancai photos are duplicated. I left the original photo, followed by the more recent one. But I added hundreds of additional photos as well. I also have 5 separate albums for the Shaanxi Provincial Museum, which has many similar artifacts. Photos by Gary L.
