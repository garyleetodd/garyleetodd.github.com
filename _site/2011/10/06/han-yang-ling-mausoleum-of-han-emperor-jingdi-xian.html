This Western Han Imperial tomb is probably China's best-kept archaeological secret. It only opened to the public a few years ago, and there is not yet public transportation to the site. The terracotta warriors are a third the size of the more famous ones of nearby Qin Shihuang's tomb, but here visitors can walk over the pits and see the excavations in progress. More importantly, this tomb doesn't have the pressing crowds of the more famous neighbor. Like the Qin Shihuang tomb, the Han Yang tomb itself has not yet been opened. Photos by Gary L.
