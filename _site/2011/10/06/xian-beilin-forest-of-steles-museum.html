This museum, just inside the South Gate of Xi'an's Ming city wall, has thousands of steles and other works of stone, including the 4 horses of Li Shimen still in China, as well as the Nestorian Stone chronicling the introduction of Christianity into China in the Tang Dynasty. As usual, I ran dreadfully short of time and have not done an adequate job of labeling. Photos by Gary L.
