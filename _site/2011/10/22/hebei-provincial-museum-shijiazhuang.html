The Hebei Provincial Museum was mostly closed for renovation in late 2011 and not scheduled to open until the end of 2012. They had but two temporary exhibits. The first was of some first class pieces from the ancient states of Yan and Zhao. The second was of relics collected in recent years at the site of the construction of the great canal which will bring water to Beijing from south of Henan. This huge construction project has uncovered thousands of ancient artifacts spanning thousands of years. Like the Provincial Museum, the City Museum was also closed in order to upgrade security.
