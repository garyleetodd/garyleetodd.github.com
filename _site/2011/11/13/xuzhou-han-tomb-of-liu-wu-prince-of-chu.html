Liu Wu was a member of the Han Dynasty royal family. He ruled over the state of Chu in the early Western Han, and built a tomb on Shizishan (Lion Hill) with a guardian army of 1/3-size terracotta warriors. I photographed the tomb, along with an underwater burial site of terracotta cavalry, and a larger pit of infantry. Compare this with the tomb of Han Emperor Jingdi, as well as the more famous life-size warriors of Qin Shihuang (both on this website). Photos by Gary L.
