Xinxiang City, which lies between Zhengzhou and Anyang, just opened this excellent, modern museum at the end of 2011. I believe I'm the first foreigner to visit it. Xinxiang is the site of the ancient battle of Muye, in which the Shang Dynasty was destroyed by the Zhou, so this area is rich in Shang artifacts. Photos by Gary L.
