I first went to China in 1991 to teach teachers during the summer. But mostly I was a tourist taking in the sights, tastes, and sounds of a new and wonderful culture. My photos of the Great Wall, Summer Palace, Forbidden City, and of Chengdu sites have already been posted in the appropriate albums. This album is all the rest of my photos - the people and places where I visited and worked. These photos themselves are now history, since many of these quaint alleys have been replaced by modern shopping malls, and the ubiquitous bicycles by bumper-to-bumper automobiles. The China in these photos is pretty much gone, the victim of prosperity and progress. Photos by Gary L.
