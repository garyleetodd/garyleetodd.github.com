The Spanish lit bonfires on this island to guide their galleons. When the Americans took over the Philippines in 1898 they turned this rock into a powerful fortress, which the Japanese severely damaged in 1941-42. The fall of Corregidor marked the end of American military presence until their return in 1944-45. Photos by Gary L.
