The Smithsonian Institution is one of the world's greatest museums - actually about 15 or so museums. These are photos of the original building - the "castle" - as well as from the new Museum of the American Indian and some miscellaneous photos. I have posted separate albums for the Freer-Sackler Chinese galleries, Western Cultures, American History, Natural History, and Air &amp; Space Museums. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of History, Sias International University, Xinzheng, Henan, China. <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/GaryLeeTodd/SmithsonianInstitutionCastleMuseumOfTheAmericanIndian02">http://picasaweb.google.com/GaryLeeTodd/SmithsonianInstitutionCastleMuseumOfTheAmericanIndian02</a>#
