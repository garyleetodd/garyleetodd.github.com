Kabah, Labna, Sayil, &amp; Xlapak lie in the Puuc Hills of Yucatan, near Uxmal. They bear a distinct and highly ornate architecture called Puuc Style. These Post-Classic sites are small and close to each other. Edzna &amp; Oxkintok are probably transitional from Classic to Post-Classic, and lie a little farther south. None of these sites has a recorded history. I took the photos in winter, 2002. Photos by Gary L.
