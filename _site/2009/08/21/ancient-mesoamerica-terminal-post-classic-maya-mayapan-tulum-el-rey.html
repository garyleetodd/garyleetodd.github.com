Mayapan has been called the last "capital" of the Maya, following the downfall of Chichen Itza. Buildings are of much poorer quality. It lasted less than a century and collapsed before the arrival of the Spanish. Tulum is a small, walled site, on the coast. Columbus probably saw lights from there when he passed by in 1502. The site was abandoned shortly afterward. El Rey is a late Maya village near Cancun. I took the photos in winter, 2001, except the Mayapan photos which I took in 2002. Photos by Gary L.
