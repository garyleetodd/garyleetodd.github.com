This is the Han Dynasty (and following) Gallery of the Shaanxi Provincial Museum in Xi'an, taken in fall, 2009, following major renovation. I have an earlier album of photos from this museum, and have posted further albums of the other galleries. These are all high-resolution photos taken with a 15+ megapixul Canon. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of History, Sias International University, Xinzheng, Henan, China. <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/GaryLeeTodd/ShaanxiProvincialMuseumHanGallery">http://picasaweb.google.com/GaryLeeTodd/ShaanxiProvincialMuseumHanGallery</a>#
