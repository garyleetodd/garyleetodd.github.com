This is the Western Zhou Gallery of the Shaanxi Provincial Museum in Xi'an, taken in fall, 2009, following major renovation. I have an earlier album of photos from this museum, and have posted further albums of the other galleries. These are all high-resolution photos taken with a 15+ megapixul Canon. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of History, Sias International University, Xinzheng, Henan, China.
