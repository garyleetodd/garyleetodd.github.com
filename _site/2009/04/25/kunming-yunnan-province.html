Kunming was home of the Flying Tigers during WWII. Today it is a clean, modern city with year-round spring climate. This album includes random shots from around town, plus a visit to the city zoo. My main interest was the two historical museums which are featured in separate photo albums. They both contain fabulous bronze artifacts from the ancient Dian Culture. Photos by Gary L.
