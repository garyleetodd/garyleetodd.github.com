I stumbled upon this museum by accident, but have always loved dinosaurs and almost majored in paleontology in college. However, I guess I just don't have enough faith to believe all the macroevolutionary dogma, especially after seeing too many evolutionists get creamed in debates with creationists who raised too many embarrassing questions. Some years ago the evolutionists circulated letters among university faculty advising them to stop debating, which tells me something about the quality of their "science." Photos by Gary L.
