This album contains photos of much of the Asian collections of Charles Freer and Arthur Sackler. Most artifacts were acquired during China's Republican era. I photographed them in July, 2009, although there are a few bronzes I photographed in 2002. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of History, Sias International University, Xinzheng, Henan, China. <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/GaryLeeTodd/ChineseAsianArtFreerSacklerGalleriesSmithsonianWashingtonDC">http://picasaweb.google.com/GaryLeeTodd/ChineseAsianArtFreerSacklerGalleriesSmithsonianWashingtonDC</a>#
