This tomb of the second king of the Nanyue Kingdom, Zhao Mo, was discovered in 1983 in Guangzhou. It dates from the 2nd century BC, in the Western Han Dynasty. The tomb had never been looted, and yielded some 11,000 relics, the most important of which are on display at the modern museum facility. A porcelain pillow collection is also on display at this museum, and is posted in another museum album on my website. Poor lighting &amp; long exposure time left some of these images blurred. My apologies. Photos by Gary L.
