In March, 2009, I took these photos of Guangzhou (Canton), China, in Yuexiu Park, Six Banyan Temple, and the Memorial Garden to the 5000 Revolutionary Martyrs killed by the Nationalists in 1927 during the suppression of the Guangzhou Commune. Yuexiu Park has a famous statue celebrating the legend of five immortals who rode on goats to bring grain to Guangzhou and assure the region's continued prosperity. The park also contains the remnants of the Ming Dynasty city wall and a monument to revolutionary leader Sun Yat-sen (Sun Zhongshan). The tower in the Six Banyan Temple dates to the 11th century. See my additional albums of the Tomb of the King of Nanyue, City Museum, and special exhibition of porcelain pillow collection. Photos by Gary L.
