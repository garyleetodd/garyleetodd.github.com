This collection of porcelain pillows was donated to Guangzhou by Hong Kong industrialist Yeung Wing Tak &amp; his wife. The collection of over 200 pillows ranges from Tang through Yuan Dynasties, with most of them made during the Song &amp; Jin Dynasties. They are housed in the Museum of the King of Nanyue near Yuexiu Park, Guangzhou. Poor lighting &amp; long exposure time left some of these images blurred. My apologies. Photos by Gary L.
