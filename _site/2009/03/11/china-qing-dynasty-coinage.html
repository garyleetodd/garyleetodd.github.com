These coins from my personal collection are from Qing Dynasty China, except for several from Japan &amp; Annam. The "S" number refers to the number in the Schjoth standard catalog of Chinese coinage. Emperor Xianfeng issued many high value coins to save copper during the Taiping Rebellion. Most of these do not have a Schjoth catalog number. Photos by Gary L.
