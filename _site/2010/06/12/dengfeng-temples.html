These are photos from several temples and historic sites around Dengfeng, excluding Shaolin Temple and the Yuan Observatory, which are in separate albums. Most major temples are mainly for tourists, but I have a couple here which are off the beaten path. The pagoda of the Songyue Temple was built in the Northern Wei Dynasty, about 1400 years ago.
