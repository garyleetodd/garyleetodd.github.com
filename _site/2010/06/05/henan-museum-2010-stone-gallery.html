This is the Henan Provincial Museum's collection of carved stones, consisting mainly of Eastern Han Dynasty tomb carvings, Buddhism sculptures, and stone honor guards. In addition to 8 museum albums from 2010, I have 3 earlier albums from this museum. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of History, Sias International University, Xinzheng, Henan, China.
