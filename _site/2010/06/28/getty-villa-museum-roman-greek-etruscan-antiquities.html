Oil baron J. Paul Getty built this villa near Los Angeles based on a Roman villa buried in the 79 AD eruption of Mt. Vesuvius. It houses his personal collection of antiquities collected from ancient Etruria, Greece, and Rome. Most pictures of artifacts are preceded by a museum label describing the artifact in greater detail.
