This was a special exhibit on Heroes of Ancient China, focusing on the Three Kingdoms era. All artifacts are from Eastern Han and Three Kingdoms. The bronze cavalry and chariots are the first originals I have been able to photograph. In addition to 8 museum albums from 2010, I have 3 earlier albums from this museum. Photos by Gary L.
