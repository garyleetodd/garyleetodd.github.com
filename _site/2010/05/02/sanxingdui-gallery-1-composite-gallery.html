Sanxingdui, near Chengdu, was an ancient city contemporary with the Shang Dynasty at Yin (Anyang), but with an art style unlike anything else in the world. Very likely the site was abandoned due to flooding, and the people moved south to Chengdu, where they became the ancestors of the Ba-Shu people of the Warring States era. I have a separate album for the bronze gallery, plus an album I took two years ago which has many Ba-Shu weapons not on display in 2010. Photos by Gary L.
