Kaifeng was once the capital of Henan Province, and this was once the provincial museum. It still has a good collection of artifacts through the ages. However, the Kaifeng Jews exhibit on the 4th floor cost 50rmb and contained two illegible stones and a stone pot. That's all. And when we complained we had been robbed, the manager refused to refund our money. There is another private museum dedicated to the Kaifeng Jewish community which is much better. Photos by Gary L.
