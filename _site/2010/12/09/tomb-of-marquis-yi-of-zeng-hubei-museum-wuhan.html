The Warring States Era Tomb of Marquis Yi of Zeng, excavated in 1978, is the highlight of the Hubei Museum's collections. The tomb contained the largest set of bronze bells ever found, plus many more first class treasures. This is one of 7 albums I've created for the Hubei Provincial Museum. Photos by Gary L.
