The Chu Culture existed in Hubei and Henan for about 800 years, during the Zhou Dynasty, until its conquest by Qin in 223 BC. It was one of the main states of China during the Spring &amp; Autumn and the Warring States eras. I have another album of Chu State bronzes from the Henan Museum in Zhengzhou. This is one of 7 albums I've created for the Hubei Provincial Museum. Photos by Gary L.
