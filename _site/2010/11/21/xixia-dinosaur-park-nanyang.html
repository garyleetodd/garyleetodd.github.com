The area around Nanyang in Henan Province is rich in fossils, and especially dinosaur eggs. The park was built at a site where eggs are excavated and features a tunnel into strata with dinosaur eggs in place. An on-site museum displays many eggs, most of which were found near Nanyang. It appears that there will be more added to the park in the future. Photos by Gary L.
