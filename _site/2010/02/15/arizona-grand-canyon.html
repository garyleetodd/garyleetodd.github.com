In June, 1971, I began hitch-hiking across America from Phoenix, Arizona. This album shows the first part of my journey, from Tempe up to the Grand Canyon, where I hiked down the South Rim and up the North Rim before resuming my hitching-hiking. I spent a week at the bottom. Regrettably, I only had one roll of BW film for the whole trip. The color photos were taken from a jet while on my way to China in 1991. Photos by Gary L.
