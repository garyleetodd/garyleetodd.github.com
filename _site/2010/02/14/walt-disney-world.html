This is Walt Disney World's Magic Kingdom, Epcot Center, and Disney Studios in Orlando, Florida, taken in summer, 2009, unless otherwise noted. Amy Todd appears in many of these. I have added digital copies of older photos from visits in the 1980s &amp; 1990s, along with a few from Disneyland California in 1976. Photos from Hong Kong Disney appear in my Hong Kong album. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of History, Sias International University, Xinzheng, Henan, China. <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/GaryLeeTodd/WaltDisneyWorld">http://picasaweb.google.com/GaryLeeTodd/WaltDisneyWorld</a>#
