In the 1980s and early 90s I lived in Illinois, where there are many railroads. In my spare time I photographed quite a few of them. I am adding all my photos to my website in 5 different albums. This one is for the major Eastern railroads. All locations are in Illinois unless otherwise noted. Photos by Gary L.
