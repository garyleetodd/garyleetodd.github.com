In the 1980s and early 90s I lived in Illinois, where there are many railroads. In my spare time I photographed quite a few of them. I am adding all my photos to my website in 5 different albums. This one is for my favorite, the Illinois Central RR, along with the Gulf, Mobile, &amp; Ohio, and the post-merger Illinois Central Gulf. I took most of these photos in the late 1980s along the ICG mainline between the Champaign ICG Yard and Tolono, unless otherwise noted. Photos by Gary L.
