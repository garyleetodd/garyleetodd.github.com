I'm somewhat of a closet railfan who grew up along the Illinois Central RR and rode the ICRR to and from the University of Illinois in the late 60s. These are copies of photos I took at several RR museums in the U.S. &amp; Britain, mostly in the 1980s &amp; early 90s, except for the one in England, which I took in 2003. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of History, Sias International University, Xinzheng, Henan, China. <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/GaryLeeTodd/RailwayMuseums#">http://picasaweb.google.com/GaryLeeTodd/RailwayMuseums#</a>
