In the 1980s and early 90s I lived in Illinois, where there are many railroads. In my spare time I photographed quite a few of them. I am adding all my photos to my website in 5 different albums. This one is rolling stock of all sorts. I took almost all of these photos in 1987-90, mostly along the ICG mainline between the Champaign ICG Yard and Tolono. Photos by Gary L.
