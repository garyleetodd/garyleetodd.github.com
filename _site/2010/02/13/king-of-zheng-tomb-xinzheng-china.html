The discovery of this tomb in Xinzheng, Henan, in 1923, along with the later discovery of FuHao's tomb in Anyang, laid the foundation for Chinese archaeology. The main tomb belonged to a King of Zheng, dating to around 575 B.C. It contained two crane &amp; lotus hu vessels, arguably the finest bronze castings made anywhere in the world. Nine bronze dings indicate the tomb's owner claimed the title of king (wang) for himself. The original tomb contents are displayed at the Henan Provincial Museum and can be seen in several of my albums of photos from this museum. The artifacts shown here are reproductions.
