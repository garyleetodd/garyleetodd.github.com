This is one of five albums from this museum. It deals with ancient bronze from Sichuan Province. Artifacts listed as Warring States are from the Ba-Shu Culture. Because bronze is my own area of special interest, and because I want to better show the results of aging, I have uploaded this album with full resolution. Photos by Gary L.
