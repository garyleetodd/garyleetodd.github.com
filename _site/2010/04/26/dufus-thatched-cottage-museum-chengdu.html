Dufu was an 8th century Tang Dynasty poet who lived 4 years in Chengdu while fleeing from the An Lushan Rebellion in the north. He built a thatched cottage and wrote many poems at a site which has been honored continuously to the present. In 1991 I visited the traditional site of the cottage. In 2001 workers discovered the foundations of Tang-era dwellings and recovered many artifacts which are now on display in a new museum, just a short distance from the traditional site. I've included displays and text which should provide more information about his life. Photos by Gary L.
