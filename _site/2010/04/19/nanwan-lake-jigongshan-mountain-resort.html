Nanwan Lake near Xinyang City in southern Henan was created by a huge dam built in the 1950s. Jigongshan (Rooster Mountain) summer resort has over 200 villas built in many international styles of architecture. Jiang Jieshi (Chiang Kai-shek) built a bunker command center here during one of his encirclement campaigns against the Communists in the early 1930s. His wife Soong Meiling used the nearby dance hall. Unfortunately, I missed most of the beautiful scenery because of heavy fog. Photos by Gary L.
