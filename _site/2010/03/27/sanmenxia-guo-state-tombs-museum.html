Guo State existed in western Henan during Western Zhou and early Spring &amp; Autumn periods. The tombs of the king and his consort, discovered in 1990, were rich in bronze &amp; jade artifacts, and contained a large chariot burial. Guo State ended with the conquest by Jin in 655 BC. I've uploaded the full resolution of the bronze artifacts and chariots, but the rest I uploaded at a lower level. Poor lighting and/or thick glass made photography of the jade very difficult.
