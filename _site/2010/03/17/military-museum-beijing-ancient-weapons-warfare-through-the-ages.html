This is my 2008 album with some new or improved photos added in 2010, and with the modern weapons removed to a separate album. In addition to the Modern Weapons album, I have another album from a special exhibit on Sunzi and Weapons in Ancient China. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of History, Sias International University, Xinzheng, Henan, China.
