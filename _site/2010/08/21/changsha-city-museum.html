The Changsha City Museum features artifacts from the city's 3000-year history. Hunan Province's most famous resident was Chairman Mao Zedong, though the city was also prominent during the Taiping Uprising in the 1850s. Most of the ancient city was destroyed either at that time, or during the anti-Japanese War. Photos by Gary L.
