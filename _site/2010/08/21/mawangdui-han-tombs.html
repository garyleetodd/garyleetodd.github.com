The Mawangdui Tombs in Changsha are one of the world's greatest archaeological treasures, due to an incredible degree of preservation. Over 3000 cultural relics have come from the tombs: pottery, lacquerware, food items, textiles, and an almost perfectly-preserved corpse of a noble woman who died over 2100 years ago. The bamboo and silk texts are the world's oldest copies of many ancient works, and in many cases, the only copies. The many labels I've included should provide considerable detail about the tomb and its contents. This display is part of the Hunan Provincial Museum. Photos by Gary L.
