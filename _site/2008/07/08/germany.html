Castles, palaces and cathedrals from all over Germany, including Mad Ludwig's Neuschwanstein Castle in Bavaria and the palace complex at Potsdam near Berlin. Also Martin Luther's Wittenberg. They are from trips in 1993, 2000, and 2001.Â These are copies of slides I took before I got a good digital camera, but I plan to make better digital copies this summer (2011) and replace most of these.
