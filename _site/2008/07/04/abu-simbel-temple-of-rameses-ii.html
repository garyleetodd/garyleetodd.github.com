<div class="gphoto-sidebar-subitem gphoto-sidebar-albumdesc">These are photos of the great Temple of Rameses II built on the southern border of Egypt during the New Kingdom. The entire temple was relocated 50 years ago to preserve it from the rising waters of Lake Nassar formed by the Aswan Dam. I have created other albums for the Cairo Museum, Old Kingdom sites, and other New Kingdom sites. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of History, Sias International University, Xinzheng, Henan, China. <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/GaryLeeTodd/AbuSimbelTempleOfRamesesII">http://picasaweb.google.com/GaryLeeTodd/AbuSimbelTempleOfRamesesII</a>#</div>
