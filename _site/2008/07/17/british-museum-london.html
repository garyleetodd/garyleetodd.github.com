This is one of the greatest museums of the world. The several times I visited there were before I got the idea to make a serious photographic record of historic artifacts, so this album scarcely does the BM justice. Check out their own website. My photos are digital copies of prints or slides, so they are not as good as my more recent photos. Several photos from the museum in Edinburgh, Scotland, are included at the end. Photos by Gary L.
