Zhengzhou was the penultimate capital of the Shang Dynasty, c. 1400 BC, with a portion of the original walls still standing. The capital was supposedly transferred to Yin (Anyang) after a devastating flood of the Huanghe (Yellow River). Today Zhengzhou is a major railway center. It was the site of a massacre by the warlord Wu Peifu of striking railway workers on February 7 (Erqi), 1923. The Erqi Incident contributed to the radicalization of Chinese workers. Recently a huge monument to First Ancestor Huangdi (the "Yellow Emperor") &amp; his rival/relative Yandi was built on the banks of the nearby Yellow River. Photos by Gary L.
