After 1929 peasants near Chengdu began finding jade artifacts. In 1986 two burial pits full of bronze vessels, heads, masks, and trees were unearthed nearby. The culture which produced them was contemporary with Yin (Shang Dynasty) culture of Anyang, c. 1200 BC. Most likely they evolved into the Jinsha Culture, and later the Ba-Shu culture. The museum features a number of Ba-Shu and Dian artifacts. In early 2010 I went back and added two greatly upgraded albums from Sanxingdui, though they no longer displayed the Ba-Shu artifacts. Check the "Chengdu" tag to find them.Â Photos by Gary L.
