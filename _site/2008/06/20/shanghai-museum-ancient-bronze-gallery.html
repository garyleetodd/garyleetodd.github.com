This album contains every artifact which was on display at the Shanghai Museum Bronze Gallery on August 23, 2008. With the National Museum still closed for renovation, the Shanghai Museum is probably the greatest museum in all China, and one of the greatest in the world. This is one of four albums I've created for some 1250 artifacts I photographed in the museum. Photos by Gary L.
