This museum in Zhengzhou was built around the artifacts from the tomb of a king of Zheng discovered in 1923 in Xinzheng. The tomb, dated to c. 575 BC, contained the famous crane and lotus urn, probably the most exquisite bronze found anywhere in the world. Superb bronzes from the state of Chu are also featured here. Artifacts in this post are from Henan Province from the beginnings of civilization through the Han Dynasty. Photos by Gary L.
