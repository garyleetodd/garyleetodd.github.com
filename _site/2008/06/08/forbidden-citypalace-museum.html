This is my Forbidden City photo album of 2008 and 2009, taken after most of the pre-Olympics renovation was finished. I've also included special exhibits of the Palace Museum: artifacts of the Imperial concubines, artifacts from the Last Emperor Aisin Gioro Puyi, National Treasures of the Qing Dynasty, and the bronze, jade, and porcelain galleries. Earlier photos from 1991, 2006, and 2007 can be seen in another album at my website. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of History, Sias International University, Xinzheng, Henan, China. <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/GaryLeeTodd/ForbiddenCityPalaceMuseum">http://picasaweb.google.com/GaryLeeTodd/ForbiddenCityPalaceMuseum</a>#
