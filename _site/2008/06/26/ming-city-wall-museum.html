This small museum is located in the one surviving tower on the southeast corner of what remains of the Ming era city wall. It features artifacts found locally, and especially items from the 1900 Yihetuan (Boxer) Uprising, which resulted in the Eight Power Invasion, or Boxer Relief Expedition. Photos by Gary L.
