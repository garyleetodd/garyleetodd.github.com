Xi'an was the capital (or near the capital) of the W Zhou, Qin, W Han, Sui &amp; Tang dynasties. The Dayan (Big Wild Goose) Buddhist Pagoda &amp; the Great Mosque date from the Tang, while the city walls &amp; bell &amp; drum towers were built during the Ming. Nearby is the tomb of First Emperor Qin Shihuang, guarded by the army of terracotta warriors. I have separate albums for that and the provincial museum. I have also included photos of Tang-style costumes &amp; dance performed for the tourist groups.Â Photos by Gary L.
