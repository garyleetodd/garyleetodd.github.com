<div class="gphoto-sidebar-subitem gphoto-sidebar-albumdesc">During the Great Depression New Salem Village was reconstructed to the way it appeared c. 1830 when Abraham Lincoln lived there. Historical reenactors add to the feeling of authenticity. The Springfield sites include the only home Lincoln ever owned (by this time he was a rich corporation lawyer), his law office, the old state capitol, and his tomb. Photos by Gary L.
