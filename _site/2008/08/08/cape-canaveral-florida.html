This is where most of our rockets were launched during the great race for space with the Russians. Canaveral is still the primary site for rocket launches today, but much of the area used in the 1950s and 1960s has been turned into a museum. These are copies of the photos I have been able to locate so far. If I ever find the rest of them, I will add them to the album. Photos by Gary L.
