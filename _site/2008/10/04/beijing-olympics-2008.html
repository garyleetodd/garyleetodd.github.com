I took the first photos just after the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing. The Olympic displays were on Tiananmen Square, except for the two at the entrance to the tomb of Emperor Wanli. I added photos from Kaifeng and from the Great Wall. In November, 2009, I visited Olympic Park again and took the closeup photos then. Photos by Gary L.
