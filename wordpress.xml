I felt like a zombie during the lectures, and the students all sat silently behind the camera, until after the camera was turned off. The best discussions all took place after the lectures.

Highlight is the Grand Buddha Niche, of which the central figure represents Maitreya, the Buddha of the Future.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Xinzheng is the birthplace (c. 2700 BC) of semi-legendary Yellow Emperor Huangdi, sometimes called the First Ancestor. In the Chunqui &amp; Zhanguo eras it was the capital of the states of Zheng and Han (770-230 BC), and features probably the largest rammed-earth city wall remaining in the world. A 1923 discovery of a tomb of a King of Zheng (Zhengwang) from c. 575 BC led to the birth of modern Chinese archaeology. In addition to a chariot burial, the tomb contained the famous bronze "crane &amp; lotus" urn, arguably the most exquisite bronze vessel ever made. Two ancient towers from Northern Song and Ming Dynasties dominate the riverside area downtown. Zheng-feng Park lies on the river next to the campus of Sias International University. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of History, Sias International University, Xinzheng, Henan, China. <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/GaryLeeTodd/XinzhengBirthplaceOfChineseCivilization#">http://picasaweb.google.com/GaryLeeTodd/XinzhengBirthplaceOfChineseCivilization#</a>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Kaifeng was the capital of the Northern Song Dynasty (960-1127 AD) as well as the Wei kingdom, 4 of the Five Dynasties, and the later part of the Jin. The current palace was rebuilt in 1743 on the ruins of the ancient one. The Iron Pagoda (named because brick tiles look like rusted iron) was built in 1049. Xiangguo Monastery features a Buddha of 1048 arms carved from a single ginkgo trunk in the 1700s. Baogong temple honors the N Song official Bao Zheng, noted for his strict &amp; impartial enforcement of the law. Millennium City recreates the grandeur of the N Song. I have new separate albums for Iron Pagoda &amp; Xiangguo. Photos by Gary L.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Xi'an was the capital (or near the capital) of the W Zhou, Qin, W Han, Sui &amp; Tang dynasties. The Dayan (Big Wild Goose) Buddhist Pagoda &amp; the Great Mosque date from the Tang, while the city walls &amp; bell &amp; drum towers were built during the Ming. Nearby is the tomb of First Emperor Qin Shihuang, guarded by the army of terracotta warriors. I have separate albums for that and the provincial museum. I have also included photos of Tang-style costumes &amp; dance performed for the tourist groups. Photos by Gary L.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Founded in 495 AD, Shaolin is where the Chan (Zen) school of Buddhism was born, along with the martial art of gongfu (kung fu). It was destroyed by a warlord in 1928, and rebuilt in the 1980s, inspired by the success of a Jet Li movie. The Forest of Pagodas consists of 246 pagodas housing the ashes of monks interred there from 791 to 1803 AD, plus one modern one for a monk who died in 2006. I think I've photographed them all during at least 5 visits. Photos by Gary L.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Forbidden City was started by Emperor Yongle (1403-1424) of the Ming Dynasty. Emperors ruled from there until the Revolution of 1911. Drum &amp; Bell Towers lie directly north of the palace. Beihai Park is northwest &amp; features a Tibetan-style White Pagoda. Jingshan Park (Coal Hill), directly north of the palace, was made from dirt removed to form the moat. The city wall dates to the early Ming. Only the southeast corner remains. Photos are from 2007, 2006, &amp; 1991. The 1991 photos will be replaced when I make better copies. I have a separate album for the Temple of Heaven, and another for 2008 &amp; 2009 visits which include the Palace Museum. Photos by Gary L.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Zhengzhou was the penultimate capital of the Shang Dynasty, c. 1400 BC, with a portion of the original walls still standing. The capital was supposedly transferred to Yin (Anyang) after a devastating flood of the Huanghe (Yellow River). Today Zhengzhou is a major railway center. It was the site of a massacre by the warlord Wu Peifu of striking railway workers on February 7 (Erqi), 1923. The Erqi Incident contributed to the radicalization of Chinese workers. Recently a huge monument to First Ancestor Huangdi (the "Yellow Emperor") &amp; his rival/relative Yandi was built on the banks of the nearby Yellow River. Photos by Gary L.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I spent the summer of 1991 teaching in Chengdu. Some photos were taken then. They are poor copies of slides which I intend to replace this summer (2011). The rest were taken during Spring Festival in 2008. I have posted additional albums from a 2010 visit to Chengdu, including the Provincial Museum, Dufu's Cottage &amp; Museum, and 3 albums from nearby Sanxingdui. Check the tag "Chengdu." Chengdu was the ancient capital of Shu Han under Liu Bei (221-223 AD), made famous by the Sanguo Yanyi (Romance of the Three Kingdoms). The giant statue of Chairman Mao sits in the center of town on the site of the ancient palace. Photos by Gary L.

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Dear Mr Todd,
the Photo 311 of 349, Henan Provincial Museum 1, Zhengzhou (prehistory through Han Dynasty) is a very interesting picture: a horse with saddle and stirrup. Can you give a datation with more precision. Mary Aiken Littauer (Early stirrups, Antiquity Journal Vol 55:214, 1981 pp 99-105) mean that the stirrup first appears in northeast
China by the fourth century AD.
What is your opinion?

with kinds regards

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I cannot date the piece more precisely without access to records of the actual excavation, assuming that such records still exist. I do know we have incontrovertible evidence of the use of stirrips by the time of the Northern Wei Dynasty. The concensus of opinion seems to be that they were introduced into China by the time of the Eastern Han by way of northern "barbarian" peoples such as the Xiongnu. But so far as I know the precise origin is unknown. I have seen different opinions by different experts, probably because that question is nowhere answered by the written records, and the archaeological evidence is at best ambiguous. I'm willing to hear more informed opinions than I am able to give.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[After 1929 peasants near Chengdu began finding jade artifacts. In 1986 two burial pits full of bronze vessels, heads, masks, and trees were unearthed nearby. The culture which produced them was contemporary with Yin (Shang Dynasty) culture of Anyang, c. 1200 BC. Most likely they evolved into the Jinsha Culture, and later the Ba-Shu culture. The museum features a number of Ba-Shu and Dian artifacts. In early 2010 I went back and added two greatly upgraded albums from Sanxingdui, though they no longer displayed the Ba-Shu artifacts. Check the "Chengdu" tag to find them. Photos by Gary L.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The terracotta army protected the tomb of First Emperor of China Qin Shihuang (221-210 BC). Photos are from Pits 1, 2, &amp; 3, and from the on-site museums. Some 8000 soldiers have been discovered and 1000 excavated to date, with only one found intact. Color faded within weeks of excavation, so work was halted for years until the problem of color stabilization was solved. Archaeologists have resumed work in Pit 1. The army was damaged in the wave of destruction at the end of the Qin Dynasty. The high-resolution photos were taken in 2009 &amp; 2011; the others in 2005, 2006 and 2007. Photos by Gary L.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Anyang was the site of the last Shang (Yin) capital, for some 255 years. In 1899 the famous oracle bones were discovered there, confirming the historicity of the last 9 of the Shang kings. Fu Hao, the consort of King Wu Ding, was buried there c. 1200 BC. She is considered China's first female general, and her tomb is the only intact Shang royal tomb discovered so far. Objects in the tomb are reproductions, but the artifacts shown in the on-site museum are all genuine. Other artifacts from Fu Hao are found in my albums from the Henan Provincial Museum in Zhengzhou or the National Museum in Beijing. The chariot burials are the earliest discovered in China. One can see the evidence for human sacrifice in many of these pictures. I have posted another album featuring the 10th century pagoda in downtown Anyang. Photos by Gary L.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The Summer Palace was designed by Jesuits to look like the great European palaces. It was built by Emperor Qianlong (1736-1795) and destroyed by the British &amp; French in 1860 during the Second Opium War. The ruins were left in place as a reminder of western imperialism. During the regency of Empress Dowager Cixi in the late 19th century, portions around Lake Kunming were repaired and used by members of the court. The infamous Marble Pavilion was repaired with funds which had been set aside to build a modern navy, and contributed to defeat in 1894-95 at the hands of Japan. Contrary to popular belief, Cixi was more a figurehead than the evil power behind the throne. Highlights of the Summer Palace include the Marble Pavilion, Temple of the Fragrance of Buddha and the Long Corridor. Photos by Gary L.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Tiananmen Square lies just south of the Forbidden City. On the north end is a large portrait of Mao Zedong, who stood on that spot on October 1, 1949, and announced the birth of the People's Republic of China. On the west side is the Great Hall of the People, China's main government building. Opposite that is the National Museum. I have another album showing a temporary exhibit while the museum was undergoing renovation. Many more albums will follow when the museum reopens. On the south end is Qianmen Gate. In the square itself is the Monument to the Revolutionary Martyrs and the Mausoleum where the body of Chairman Mao lies on public display. Near the "Maosoleum" are heroic statues depicting workers, peasants, &amp; soldiers building the socialist revolution. Photos taken in 2007, 2006, and 1991. Photos by Gary L.

Unfortunately, it has been under renovation for the last several years, and is not scheduled to open until 2010. These photos are from a small temporary exhibit they had there in 2006, along with the wax museum in the same complex. When the museum reopens I intend to make significant additions to this album.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The first photos are of the Sacred Way leading to the Valley of the Thirteen Tombs of the Ming emperors. The remaining photos are of Dingling, the tomb of Emperor Wanli, the only one which has been excavated and opened to the public. The Thirteen Tombs, about 45 km NW of Beijing, contains tombs of most Ming emperors. They are the earliest tombs with still-standing top structures, and have not been completely looted. Dingling, the tomb of Wanli (1573-1620), a long-reigning but disastrous emperor, was scientifically excavated in the 1950s and is open to the public. Artifacts are from the museum at the Ding tomb. All photos were taken on National Day, October 1, 2008, except the final ones which were taken in 1991. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of History, Sias International University, Xinzheng, Henan, China. <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/GaryLeeTodd/MingTombs">http://picasaweb.google.com/GaryLeeTodd/MingTombs</a>#]]></content:encoded>

Large numbers of Russian tourists frequent the beaches, so most signs are in Russian. Westward along the coast lies Nanshan (South Mountain) Culture Zone, a Buddhist theme-park with a 108-meter tall statue of the 3-faced Boddhisattva Guanyin built out in the ocean. It is the second tallest statue in the world. The site also contains the world's largest gold &amp; jade buddha statue. Photos by Gary L.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This is one of the greatest museums of the world. The several times I visited there were before I got the idea to make a serious photographic record of historic artifacts, so this album scarcely does the BM justice. Check out their own website. My photos are digital copies of prints or slides, so they are not as good as my more recent photos. Several photos from the museum in Edinburgh, Scotland, are included at the end. Photos by Gary L.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[By definition there was no "Civil War" in America. A civil war is when two sides fight for control of one country. Historically accurate terms include War Between the States, War for Southern Independence, or War of Northern Aggression. As usual, the winners wrote the history, and in this case, named the conflict. I have photographed numerous battlefields, and added a few photos of other historically-relavant places like capitol buildings, homes of leading personalities, tombs, monuments, and museums.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="gphoto-sidebar-subitem gphoto-sidebar-albumdesc">This was the first time that "Red China" exhibited in a World's Fair, and its pavilion was arguably the highlight of the fair. I've been told the terracotta warriors from the tomb of Qin Shihuang were, in fact, reproductions, but the rest of the craftsmanship exhibited there was outstanding. The display of circus miniatures was pretty impressive as well. Overall, the 1964-65 New York World's Fair and Expo 67 in Montreal were bigger and more impressive. I have recently added a new album of B&amp;W photos from those fairs. Photos by Gary L.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[These are mostly scenic photos of West Coast states: California, Oregon, Washington, &amp; Alaska. The faded photos date from 1976. The Alaska photos are from a layover during a flight from China to America in 1991. I took the Mount Saint Helen's photos just after learning my dad had passed away in 2000, so my heart wasn't really into the photography then. My son Marcus was in Army Language School in Monterey in 2006 when we visited there, and the Sequoia National Forest photos were taken shortly afterward when we visited Amy's cousin and her family.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;quot;Calibri&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;sans-serif&amp;quot;; mso-ascii-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-hansi-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-bidi; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA;">The idea for this website has evolved over the last few years. Initially, all I wanted to do was to send photos of China back to friends and family in America and the world. <!--more--></span>

<span style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;quot;Calibri&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;sans-serif&amp;quot;; mso-ascii-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-hansi-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-bidi; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA;"> </span>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;">I simply attached the photos to my emails until Yahoo abandoned this option several years ago. I had to look elsewhere to send my photos. Someone suggested Facebook, so I joined and created several albums. Then someone said Picasaweb could host far more photos, so I created several dozen photo albums of Chinese historic and scenic places. By this time I was using PowerPoints for all my history lectures, creating outlines so students could more easily follow my lectures. Since I had quite a few photos I've taken over the years, I naturally added them to my PowerPoint presentations. Students wanted copies of the photos, so I added albums of historic places around the world. I also started to photograph Chinese museums to illustrate my lectures on Chinese history. Since my recent photos are all high-resolution, people interested in Chinese artifacts began to write and thank me for making these available. So by the spring of 2008 I decided to attempt to photograph every displayed artifact in every museum in China and make the photos available to anyone in the world. This is probably an impossible goal. But as my database grows, its usefulness to scholars and other interested people will increase.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;">At present I have created categories for photos of <strong>Chinese Historic Sites</strong>, <strong>Chinese Museums</strong>, and <strong>Chinese Scenic Places</strong>. I also created the same three categories for the United States, and finally, the same three for the rest of the world. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">Â </span>Unfortunately, my earlier photos were all slides and prints which I copied with a digital camera, so the viewer will probably notice a difference in quality between my earlier and more recent albums. One of my photo albums is in a category by itself. It is part I, section D, entitled <strong>Sias International University</strong>. This is where I work. It is a pretty amazing place. I will write more about it later.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;">The second part of this website will consist of 28 lectures on Chinese history. These were commissioned in 2007 and completed in the fall of that year. The college which commissioned them never followed through, so I decided to make them available for free to people who want the knowledge but don't care about the academic credit. The more I think about them, the more unhappy I am with my performance. The PowerPoint text is generally good, and the photos also, but all of us found the presence of a camera to be intimidating. I normally thrive on classroom interaction with students, but everyone sat in back of the camera and generally remained silent as long as the camera was running. All the good discussions occurred after the camera was turned off, so you won't see these. I guess I tend to view those lectures as a sort of rough draft or dress rehearsal. I will improve the PowerPoints for future classes and hope my actual performance in person will prove somewhat more exciting. Since doing these lectures, I have learned some new things, or been exposed to new interpretations. These will not be reflected on the website lectures, but will be incorporated into future live classes. I will probably add essays to my website to correct or update my lectures. On a technical note, these lectures require a massive amount of computer memory, so it will take some time before they are fully uploaded. Because my technological skills are limited, someone else will be doing the actual work of uploading them. I will be mainly doing the photo albums and the essays.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;">The third part of this website will consist of essays, or blogs. I've taught for over thirty years and am currently in my fourth year as professor of history at Sias International University in Xinzheng, China. We have over 100 foreigners on our faculty. Many of them are recent graduates with little teaching experience. Others have taught before, but not in China. I'm hoping to share my insights and experiences with them, although what I write will be posted for anyone in the world to read. Some of the essays will be aimed at our own community of foreign teachers or others new to life in China. Others will discuss history, historiography, education, and social commentary. One project I hope to undertake is to write a history of my own city of Xinzheng, which is quite literally the birthplace of Chinese civilization. So far as I know, almost nothing in English has been published on that topic. Just looking at my Xinzheng photo album (under Chinese Historic Places) should tell you something about its fascinating past. Finally, I hope to write about some "life lessons," those things which I have learned through some 59 years of living and making mistakes. I believe I have learned at least a couple of things which people might find useful.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;">A note about my photography: I started taking photos with a Brownie Bullseye camera using 620 film with 8 shots to a roll. I was 8 years old then, the same age at which I first experienced the symptoms of Tourette's Syndrome. By the time I was 11 I had sold my first photo (of an experimental airplane) to the <em>Register Republic</em> newspaper of Rockford, Illinois. It was used to accompany an article written by my father, who was aviation and business editor of the newspaper. I'll write more about my dad in the future, because he was a World War II P-47 fighter pilot, and I grew up around airplanes. Some years later dad got me a Fujica half-frame 35mm camera, and some of the earliest photos on this website were taken with that. I graduated to a Nikon SLR around 1978 while living in Duluth, Minnesota. I generally took slides because they were cheaper, but I later got a second Nikon, and when I went to China in 1991 carried two cameras with me, one for slides and one for prints. I generally used the print camera for people photos, and the slide camera for photos of historic interest. For really important shots I often took both a slide and a print. By that time I had a Ph.D. in history and was on the lookout for pictures I could project onto a screen to illustrate my history classes. I seem to have been one of the few professional historians who was also a serious amateur photographer, but I thought the combination of interests was ideal. Not everyone agreed with me. Professional historians frequently couldn't look beyond written documents as sources of history, while family and friends thought I was wasting my time photographing all sorts of inanimate things that might someday be of limited historical value. Nevertheless, I plodded along taking my photos, oblivious to the fact that people thought I was wasting my time.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;">The terror events of 9-11 2001 started a chain reaction which led ultimately to my losing my teaching jobs and all of my plans for my future. But I recovered and moved to the Philippine island of Mindanao where I lived for a year with my wife Amy. I still used the old Nikon film cameras. It took nearly a year before my government would let me return with my wife, but we finally got back to Georgia where I could find no meaningful employment. I'll probably tell about the American education system in a future essay, but finally, I answered a magazine ad and went to China to teach. China became the land of opportunity for me. I know that after teaching there one summer in 1991 I was never quite as happy living in America. So I returned to China and ended up right in the birthplace of Chinese civilization, and within short driving distance of many ancient capitals and other historic sites. Time to get back into photography!</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;">I'm somewhat of a technophobe, so I had resisted digital photography for quite some time. But when I lived in America, I had to survive by selling off my family heirlooms and assorted junk on eBay. This required a digital camera, so I started with a 4 megapixel Minolta. It worked fine for shooting stuff I was selling, as I could plug the camera into a wall socket and shoot forever. But when I took it to China, it turned out to be a battery-eater. Besides, I had been using single lens reflex cameras for years, and this little rangefinder was just too limited for the opportunities which were beginning to present themselves. I got Amy an 8 megapixel Sony, and this inspired me to upgrade to something that was nearly professional quality. I then invested in a 10 megapixel Canon SLR, which is what I am currently using. While it doesn't totally solve the problem of bad lighting, museum prohibitions against using tripods and flash, and shooting through glass which is at the same time reflecting multiple light sources, it does give me some pretty good images most of the time. The high resolution is especially helpful to people who want to study the images in detail, so this is pretty much where I am at today in my photography.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;">Many beautiful books of Chinese artifacts have been printed, but most of them are in Chinese and are not readily available to most people in the world. Moreover, the photos published in books tend to be mostly of the state treasure variety. I think the more common artifacts sometimes tell us more about the past than do the artistic masterpieces created for the elites. I know museums around the world are beginning to put their collections online. So far this has not happened in China, which has probably the largest number of ancient artifacts of any country in the world, and one of the longest and most fascinating histories. So until the professionals get the world's museums photographed, labeled, and made freely available to everyone in the world, I intend to do my best to photograph everything I can find of historic or aesthetic value. Since my home is now in China, this means mostly artifacts of Chinese history. I am, however, going through all my old photographs as I am able to locate them, and putting online everything which is even remotely related to history. Sometimes I have only poor-quality digital photos of print pictures, or photos of slides projected onto a wall, which means that many of my earlier photos are not so good. But some of the things I have in my collection are unique, so I figure that a poor photo may be better than no photo at all. I really don't expect to profit personally from this website, but only want to give back to the world some of the things I have been privileged to see and photograph, or some of the lessons I have learned.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;">While part of this website is intended as a resource for scholars and educated laymen, it is, in fact, my personal website. It deals with the things which are of interest to me. I take full responsibility for any ideas which I will express here. I will try to get my facts correct and my opinions well-founded, but I am only human. I have made many mistakes before, and I do not believe that I have yet attained perfection. Hopefully the benefits of this website will outweigh the liabilities.</p>

		<title>Reflections on the Problem of Cheating</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">One thing I frequently hear foreign teachers in China complain about is cheating. It's almost as if they were totally unfamiliar with this concept before they came to China. Let me put things into perspective here.<!--more--></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Chinese students cheat. Apparently they have been doing this for quite some time, because in the Capital Museum in Beijing is a student's cheat sheet from the old Imperial Examination. But American students cheat, too. The difference seems to be that the Chinese students are more likely to get caught. All this really tells me is that Chinese students are not as effective at cheating as are their American counterparts.</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">I've been in the teaching business for some thirty years, and, quite frankly, the cheating I've seen in China doesn't come close in either quantity or sophistication to the cheating I've seen in America. Let's start with one hard fact. Studies have been done asking American students whether or not they have ever cheated. Since these surveys preserve the student's anonymity, there is a pretty good chance they are a fairly accurate reflection of reality. Basically, the studies tell us that nearly all American students admit to having cheated at some time in their academic career, and some do so quite regularly.</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Back when I was a graduate student the campus bulletin boards were full of notepads advertising papers "for research only." Despite this disclaimer, it was obvious that the student was purchasing someone else's term paper to submit as his own work. I experienced some of this personally because I always assigned a 10-page research paper for students in my <strong>Ancient Near East &amp; Greece</strong> and my <strong>Ancient Rome</strong> history classes. Imagine my surprise when a student whose classroom performance indicated he was about as intelligent as a houseplant submitted a paper worthy of a Pulitzer! Of course today the Internet has replaced those notepads stapled to bulletin boards. However, today there also exists technology making it possible for a teacher to determine whether or not a student paper was obtained from an online databank or plagiarized from some published source.</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Plagiarized term papers, stolen examinations, and students peeking at their neighbor's answer sheet are but the tip of the iceberg. I was once a professor at Southern Illinois University at Carbondale. I had a friend there who had never attended college, but who made a decent living writing master's theses and doctoral dissertations for other people. All they had to do was submit the topic, a few sources, and a one-page sample of their writing style, and my friend did the rest. So I know for a fact that there are people with SIUC doctorates and masters degrees who never actually earned them. I rather doubt that my friend was the only person in America with such a lucrative business, nor that Carbondale was the only school in America producing unearned graduate degrees. It seems that every year we are treated to yet another example of some big-name academic who got his/her job on the basis of phony credentials. I believe the former president of no less an institution than Yale University recently resigned when it was discovered that her resume had been a fraud.</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">So when you put it into global perspective, the fact that one Chinese student at Sias University wrote the answers to his exam on the back of his girlfriend's neck and then sat directly in back of her during the exam should not be too shocking. What is more shocking is the extent of corruption rampant throughout our society, or rather, throughout the entire world. I have often said that for every example of corruption or dishonesty I have ever experienced or heard about in China, I have personally witnessed something at least as bad in America. The fact is that people are pretty much the same wherever you go in the world.</span></span></p>

		<title>My Philosophy and Practice of Grading</title>
		<link>http://www.garyleetodd.com/v-essays-and-blogs/my-philosophy-and-practice-of-grading/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt; text-indent: 0.5in;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Calibri;">I have taught for over 30 years, mostly history, but also courses in philosophy, government &amp; political science, psychology, English, and a few other things. I have taught in public and private high schools, public community colleges, a private sectarian college I helped to found, maximum and medium security penitentiaries, two major American universities, and two Chinese universities. Throughout that time my philosophy and practice of grading has not changed one bit.<!--more-->My guiding principle for teaching is that the teacher is first and foremost a servant. I am in the classroom to help the student learn, not to inflict my personal prejudices on my students or feed my own ego. I will never consciously violate the trust placed in me by my school or my students, and when I am uncertain about a student's conduct or achievement, I will always give the student the benefit of the doubt. I always set a much higher standard for myself than I do for my students. However, I also try to push them a little, and generally try to make my first examinations slightly intimidating. A little hard work and sweat rarely hurt anyone.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt; text-indent: 0.5in;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Calibri;">Grading is not an exact science. It is as much an art as it is a science, and any teacher who thinks he can tell exactly what a student has earned, probably doesn't know what he is talking about. My favorite evidence for this is a study done some years ago in which hundreds of experienced teachers were given thousands of student papers to grade. They were told each student's grade level, and asked to evaluate each student's performance. Every student in the study received every grade from A to F! At the very least, this should remind us of the extremely subjective nature of grading. Even teachers who use "objective examinations" must subjectively choose which facts to emphasize and which to ignore. Knowing this, the teacher should make allowance for his limitations and should evaluate his pupils with a certain amount of humility and uncertainty.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt; text-indent: 0.5in;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Calibri;">In determining final grades, I have a rule. When a student is very close to the border between two grades, I will give him the higher grade, unless the student has repeatedly missed classes. Over the years I have given many students one letter grade higher than their total scores indicated they actually earned. But I have never given any student two letter grades higher. I am willing to give the student the benefit of the doubt up to a point, but I do insist in maintaining reasonable standards. I have never in my life given a student a lower grade than what I honestly believed that student earned. Never. I do not penalize students who disagree with me or who hold different religious or political views. I have known many teachers who do this, but I consider this the height of arrogance and unprofessional conduct. I encourage my students to disagree with me, so long as they have intelligent reasons for doing so. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">During the Vietnam War when male students who flunked out of college could be drafted into the military, there was an anti-war professor at my university who claimed he gave "A" grades to all male students to help them keep out of the war. To balance the class average he gave "F" grades to female students who allegedly had nothing to lose. There was another professor who claimed he threw student papers down the stairs and assigned them grades based upon which step each paper landed. Longer research papers are heavier and thus travelled farther, so they deserved the higher grades. Pure physics, according to the professor. And I have a good friend who never went to college because her English teacher gave her a "B" grade on a paper which the teacher never actually read. This caused my friend to miss earning a scholarship by a fraction of a point, and without the scholarship, she could not afford college. A couple of years later the teacher actually looked at the paper and remarked that it was a truly excellent paper. Of course it was then too late to help her student, but it does provide a negative example of the consequences of lazy and dishonest teaching practices.</span></span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">I have friends who tell me about how bad things are in China in the area of human rights. Most of them have never been to China, but they have read a book or heard something from someone, or just generally remember how bad communists have always been. Here are my thoughts on the matter.<!--more--></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">I'm sure abuses exist. I've lived in China almost four years and have never actually seen any abuses, nor have I ever heard any first-hand accounts of any. But I know something about human nature, so I believe they must exist. People are probably shaken down by crooked cops, and people with little power are probably beaten without good cause. However, if this were a widespread phenomenon, I think it would be reflected on the faces of the people. I would expect to see fear in the eyes of citizens of a police state. Instead I mostly see people living out normal, uneventful lives. The ambitious ones are mostly busy trying to get into a good university. If they have graduated, they are mostly busy trying to get into graduate school or get a good job. Some are busy trying to get rich. The peasants are busy doing the boring sorts of things that peasants normally do. I've never seen anyone look like they feared anyone in uniform here. Rather, I see people constantly cutting in front of cop cars on the streets and mostly ignoring the police.</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">What makes me look at this issue differently from most people is that I have lived with a plate in my forehead for nearly four decades. You see, around 1971 I was in a city park in Rockford, Illinois, when the cops busted a friend of mine for no other reason than that his hair was too long. I protested this illegal arrest and promptly got handcuffed. All the way to the police station a patrolman with the nametag R BAST kept taunting me about my own hair, accusing me of being a queer. This to me suggested that the officer had struggles with his own sexual orientation, and was trying to hide it with an excessive display of macho. Anyway, at the police station he started beating up my friend. I peered around the corner to witness it, and promptly got thrown to the floor and kicked around.</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Now the next episode is probably the stupidest thing I have ever done in my life, but a good cop should have never reacted the way he did. Assuming that R BAST was in fact a latent homosexual, I blew him a kiss right in front of his fellow officers. I had great fun with that for about three seconds. Then he started pounding my head repeatedly onto the concrete floor of the police station. Right above me was a sign prominently advising me of my rights, one of which was my alleged right not to be abused. All during this time about a dozen of Rockford's Finest were laughing. This included a guy wearing sergeant's stripes. So I guess you can tell me people get tortured in China, but I would have to reply, "So what? How is that any different from what happened to me in democratic America?"</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">The next day they put me in a holding cell with a black guy who had been badly worked over the night before. The cops had covered his body with welts, probably with a rubber hose. I suspect it was partly intended as an object lesson for me. They also added a bunch of extra charges to my initial disorderly conduct, none of which had any legal merit. When they brought me before a judge, the judge simply handed me a paper to sign. In exchange for my immediate release, I agreed to never press charges against the city or police force of Rockford. I had little choice. I suspect if I hadn't signed, I would have ended up like that black guy. So I signed and they released me. In 1973 I had to have part of my skull replaced with plastic and steel because the fracture had created a situation where the spinal fluid was seeping through and filling up my forehead. This led to a whole series of other problems, but that is a different story.</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Epilog: <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>R BAST became one of the elite SWAT team some time later. One day he was suspended for a week for beating up some Mexican fellow he caught sleeping at the Colonial Bakery, where, surprisingly, the Mexican was employed. A few years later my dad sent me a news article about Richard Bast, Junior, who was arrested for armed robbery. I guess people really do reap what they sow.</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">None of this actually proves that the Chinese population is <em>not</em> being systematically abused, but whenever I hear those accusations, I have to think back on my own experience. My opinion is that we should clean up our own house first before we presume to clean up our neighbor's. Or, to borrow someone else's metaphor, perhaps we should remove the log from our own eye before we try to remove the speck from the other guy's eye.</span></span></p>

		<title>Huangdi:  First Ancestor of the Chinese People</title>
		<link>http://www.garyleetodd.com/v-essays-and-blogs/huangdi-first-ancestor-of-the-chinese-people/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> Xinzheng, in Henan Province, is best known as the birthplace of Huangdi, the "Yellow Emperor." I am going to attempt to make some sense of the Huangdi legends. However, I should point out that what we actually know about Huangdi is approximately nothing, so anything I say may be almost as useless as everything else people say about him. <!--more--><span style="mso-tab-count: 1;"> </span>Tradition says that Huangdi was born in Xinzheng about 4700 years ago. This is contemporary with the 4<sup>th</sup> Dynasty of the Old Kingdom in Egypt, the dynasty which built the great pyramids at Giza. Huangdi had a younger brother (cousin, relative, or whatever) named Yandi, or Emperor Yan. One story says Huangdi and Yandi fought a series of bloody battles for control of the North China Plain. Some say Yandi was the ancestor of the Korean people. Some versions of the story say the two reconciled and, presumably, lived happily ever after.</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> Huangdi is credited with the invention of boats, wagons, the bow and arrow, clothing, silk, ceramics, writing, the calendar, and possibly the Internet. An ugly (but wise) wife of Huangdi is honored as the inventor of weaving, while another wife allegedly started sericulture, the raising of silkworms. And it wasn't Huangdi himself, but rather a minister commissioned by Huangdi who actually invented writing. Likewise, Yandi is honored as the originator of farming, Chinese medicine, and irrigation. Huangdi was also the first of five great Sage Emperors who ruled before the first historic dynasty.</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">What, if any, of this can be believed?</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1;"> </span>Most scholars, especially in the West, are inclined to dismiss the stories as mere legend. After all, the first written records which have survived didn't appear until some 2500 years after he lived. That's a long time to transmit an oral tradition with any accuracy, although, I suppose, one could argue that perhaps the stories were once written down long ago and later lost.</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1;"> </span>We do believe that sericulture was invented at about this time period, and that writing could have been invented about this same time. The oracle bones found at the Shang capital of Yin (modern Anyang) date to around 1300 BC and contain some 5000 characters. A language of this complexity would have taken hundreds of years to evolve, which puts its origins at least in the same millennium as Huangdi. However, there are some elements of the legends which do not seem to fit the facts.</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1;"> </span>For example, Huangdi is credited with inventing chariots, or wagons. I suppose anything is possible. But the first archaeological evidence for chariots appears at Yinxu (Anyang) at about 1200 BC, some 1500 years after Huangdi lived. Most scholars believe the technology was learned from the peoples of the steppes.</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1;"> </span>Then there is the famous South Pointing Cart which Huangdi allegedly invented and used to defeat an enemy during a fog. It is a mechanical wagon with a standing figure whose outstretched arm always points south. This is done through a series of gears connected to the wheels, so that no matter which way the wagon turns, the arm still points in the same direction. It is ingenious, and we actually do have such a machine in Chinese history. But it is attributed to an inventor during the Northern Song, about 3700 years after Huangdi. At any rate this is the first verifiable record of this invention.</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1;"> </span>While I have seen nothing in the legends which state that Huangdi carried a massive William Wallace-type sword, nevertheless, he is usually depicted carrying one. It looks impressive, but the fact remains that the <em>jian</em> - the Chinese double-edged bronze sword - does not appear in the literary or the archaeological record until around 600 BC, some 2000 years after Huangdi.</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1;"> </span>The portrait of Huangdi from which all the heroic images and statues of today derive comes from a Ming encyclopedia published in 1607. Interestingly, kings and emperors depicted there ranging over a 2500-year period are all shown wearing the same headdress, which looks something like a Western graduation mortarboard. I realize that China is a very conservative culture, but 2500 years of following the same style does seem a bit unlikely. I don't really think anyone has a clue as to what Huangdi actually looked like.</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1;"> </span>Now here I am going make a statement which I cannot defend, namely, that I believe Huangdi really existed. The more I study ancient cultures, the more respect I have for the essential validity of oral tradition. I don't agree with many of the details, but I do think there is an historical person behind all the legends. Let me propose the following scenario:</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1;"> </span>Huangdi was probably a tribal leader who lived and ruled for a long time. During his lifetime people began to make the transition from a hunting and gathering culture to an agricultural culture. Many of the inventions which helped make up civilization came into being around this time. Probably he was remembered as a wise leader. People tended to attribute to him personally events and inventions which began during his reign. During the following centuries people embellished the story by attributing everything invented in the remote past to him.</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1;"> </span>The title "emperor," however, only adds to the confusion. We must not think of emperor here as someone like Caesar or Napoleon. A better analogy would be a tribal chieftain like Geronimo. I actually used this analogy with a visiting delegation from the Apache Nation in Arizona, and they understood and appreciated it. A week later I again used it with another group of visitors from the Northern Flyover Zone, and someone in that group took such offense to my analogy that I was fired from giving the rest of my history lectures. Having thought about it since, I now realize my Geronimo analogy was misguided. I think Sequoyah would be a much better example. Sequoyah, like Huangdi, presided over the development of a written language. Likewise, Sequoyah represents a settled, agricultural culture rather than a nomadic hunting and gathering one. Nevertheless, I stand by my tribal analogy. Huangdi did not live at Versailles, nor did he control a mighty empire. At best he was head man over a village or a developing town and its surrounding agricultural zone. Even the words "capital" and "city" are too anachronistic at this early stage of Chinese civilization.</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1;"> </span>The problem of Huangdi goes to the very heart of the problem of the uses and abuses of history. The Huangdi stories are not perpetuated by serious historians who seek an accurate understanding of the past. Huangdi is more important as a symbol than as an actual person. As a symbol, he serves a contemporary cultural and political agenda.</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>A brief history of the Huangdi Temple in Xinzheng is in order. The temple itself was first built during the Han Dynasty, at the site where people had honored the birth of Huangdi for over 2500 years. Like most temples in China, it was renovated many times over the centuries. It suffered destruction during the Cultural Revolution in the campaign to eliminate Old Thinking. In the 1980s it was rebuilt and greatly enlarged. At that time many other temples throughout China were also rebuilt. I suspect that part of the reason may have been a sincere desire to atone for the excesses of the past. But also, part of the reason may have been to send a message to the Chinese outside the mainland. The message, in my opinion, was something like, "your ancestral faith is now safe in China." This message was aimed particularly at Chinese living in Hong Kong and Taiwan. At that time it was not yet certain that Hong Kong would be returned to China following its 150-year occupation by the British. Having viewed the excesses of the Cultural Revolution, the Chinese population of Hong Kong was pretty apprehensive about the possibility of rejoining the mainland.</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1;"> </span>Hong Kong, of course, returned to China peacefully in 1997. Today, some eleven years later, the threat of oppression from the mainland has been put to rest. The people's worst fears proved unfounded. The city is fabulously prosperous, while individual liberties have not diminished one bit. But in 1980, one could have hardly predicted it. In my opinion, the decision to rebuild the temples was part of a plan to peacefully win over the people of those two regions, to demonstrate to them that religion was now safe to practice in China. The Huangdi story assumed even greater significance, in that the majority of the Chinese people consider him their First Ancestor. The appeal then became, "come back to China, the land of your ancestors."</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1;"> </span>Xinzheng now hosts an annual Huangdi celebration every spring. Thousands of Chinese visitors come to hear speeches and offer incense at the shrine of their ancestor. Thousands of townspeople and students from Sias University line the main highway, drumming and lion-dancing, as busses of visitors pass by on their way to the temple. Just a few years ago an entire city block was torn down to make room for the temple's expansion, which includes a wall listing some 3000 family names of all the Chinese people.</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1;"> </span>Nearby in Zhengzhou a giant statue of Huangdi and Yandi, complete with a large altar, was recently erected overlooking the Huang He or Yellow River. One Internet source states that it is the fourth tallest statue in the world. Of course, the revival of Huangdi worship is not in isolation. The government is stressing the virtues taught by Kongzi (Confucius), has rebuilt many Daoist and Buddhist temples, and created a new Buddhist theme park on Hainan Island. (See my photo album for "Sanya &amp; Hainan Island," posted at my website under "Chinese Scenic Places." The 108-meter tall statue of Bodhisattva Guanyin is reputedly the second-tallest statue in the world.) Moreover, the official Three Self Protestant Church has constructed many new church buildings, including a large, cathedral-sized one across the street from my own campus. While the Communist Party is still officially atheist, and the government publicly discourages superstition, religion is making a major comeback in China and religious liberty appears very much a reality today.</span></span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[White Horse Temple (Baima si) is where tradition says Buddhism first took root in China in the first century with sacred texts brought from India on two white horses. At that time Luoyang was capital of the Eastern or Latter Han Dynasty. Unfortunately, the pagoda was under repair when I visited on November 22, 2008, and was still under repair in June, 2010.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[From 770 to 256 BC Luoyang was capital of the Eastern Zhou Dynasty, although the Zhou king was little more than a figurehead or ceremonial leader. This royal tomb was discovered during excavation for a building project. It contains the first 6-horse chariot ever found in China, almost certainly the chariot of the Zhou king. Unlike the Xinzheng chariot burial where the wagons are thrown into a pit, these are all arranged in battle formation. The tomb itself lies beneath the chariots. Photos by Gary L.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[When Liu Bang (Han Gaozu) founded the Han Dynasty he established commanderies to govern part of his empire, and kingdoms for his relatives and loyal supporters. Mangdang Mountain near Shangqui is the site of tombs belonging to the Han royal family which ruled the Liang Kingdom. Original tomb furnishing were looted in antiquity; ones shown here are reproductions. The jade burial suit actually excavated here is in the Henan Museum in Zhengzhou. The wall around the old city of Shangqui was built in 1511. The temple to Shang ancestors depicts the "Chinese business ancestor" and includes a Yuan Dynasty temple built on the site of the ancient Shang observatory. The other modern temple nearby is dedicated to the legendary discoveror of fire. The tomb itself was rebuilt in 2003 on the traditional site. Photos by Gary L.

These were of all new artifacts heretofore unphotographed by me. The remainder I took May 2, 2009. The exhibit had been greatly changed, with some of the museum's greatest treasures added. Some of the later photos are of objects which may also be seen in two earlier Henan Provincial Museum albums on my website. In early 2010 I added 4 new albums to my website taken from the museum after renovation. Photos by Gary L.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Communism in China today is as scarce as hen's teeth. The free market has totally transformed China, leaving only symbols of the past. The closest thing to communism I have found is the Nanjie Commune in Henan Province. It is actually organized as on old-fashioned commune with each member receiving a nominal allowance, plus free food &amp; housing. A few members are engaged in agriculture, but most work in the commune's 20 or so industries, which produce beer, bricks, and a famous brand of noodles. Also tourism. People visit Nanjie to see a model commune in action, and also a quite attractive greenhouse exhibit. Photos by Gary L.

When the Americans took over the Philippines in 1898 they turned this rock into a powerful fortress, which the Japanese severely damaged in 1941-42.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Boracay's white sand beach has been rated as one of the best beaches in the world. Most people get there by flying to Caticlan and taking a small ferry to Boracay Island. We circled the island about ten times while waiting to land; hence, the nice aerial views. We also took a catamaran to nearby Crystal Cove and all around Boracay, with several stops for snorkling at coral reefs. Photos by Gary L.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This is my personal collection of Chinese coins from the beginning of civilization through the Five Dynasties period, about a thousand years ago. Four more coin albums have been posted. Most of these are quite common, and wealthier collectors will have much better examples. But I included these because they show the effects of aging and often lengthy burial. I welcome any corrections, as I am not an expert in this area. The "S" number refers to the number in the Schjoth standard catalog of Chinese coinage. Photos by Gary L.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The coins pictured here are all from the Northern and Southern Song Dynasties. The "S" number refers to the number in the Schjoth standard catalog of Chinese coinage. This is followed by the emperor who issued the coin, his reign date, and usually the particular reign title era in which the coin was issued. Northern Song coins are particularly plentiful, cheap, and rarely faked. Photos by Gary L.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In March, 2009, I took these photos of Guangzhou (Canton), China, in Yuexiu Park, Six Banyan Temple, and the Memorial Garden to the 5000 Revolutionary Martyrs killed by the Nationalists in 1927 during the suppression of the Guangzhou Commune. Yuexiu Park has a famous statue celebrating the legend of five immortals who rode on goats to bring grain to Guangzhou and assure the region's continued prosperity. The park also contains the remnants of the Ming Dynasty city wall and a monument to revolutionary leader Sun Yat-sen (Sun Zhongshan). The tower in the Six Banyan Temple dates to the 11th century. See my additional albums of the Tomb of the King of Nanyue, City Museum, and special exhibition of porcelain pillow collection. Photos by Gary L.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I believe that the Sias foreign faculty receive better food and housing than any other foreigners in China. For proof I submit food photos taken from April 2 through April 8, 2009. They include most main courses, but not most of the side dishes like bread, butter, jelly, peanut butter, salad, fruit, yogurt, coffee, cocoa, etc. New dishes are constantly being added, and unpopular ones replaced. Foreign teachers occasionally submit their favorite recipes, which sometimes end up as regular menu items. Two years ago we had a full time American chef, who introduced some of the more popular items which are still on the menu. This photo album was created in part to allow feedback on the menu.

Most lie abandoned today, but I found one still occupied in a village near Luoyang, in Henan Province. It belonged to a family which built it some 200 years ago.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Calibri;">I've been to lots of graduations over the years, daydreamed through countless graduation speeches, and watched endless streams of eager graduates march off into their futures. And I've probably forgotten everything I've ever seen or heard at all those graduations. Until now. <!--more--></span></p>
<span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-size: small;">Sias University, where I teach history and do other academic-like things, just held its 2009 graduation in its new indoor sports arena/assembly hall. This graduation was actually rather special. I had taught hundreds of the graduating seniors back when they were freshmen. And again when they were juniors, I taught many of them British and American history. Since the students I now teach are all juniors or seniors, I will never again have the same classes for different courses and in different years. Some of those students are very special to me. A select group of about 5 or 6 of them formed a pool from which I recruited people to accompany me to Zhengzhou either to help negotiate deals, or just to share some yang rou and noodles, or western-style pizza. More about my students later.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-size: small;">What struck me about this particular graduation, and what I will always remember, was one seemingly insignificant response to a minor accident. One of the speakers lost her hat. No big deal, but without missing a beat, the university's president, Li Haijun, who was seated with all the dignitaries on stage, got up from his seat, walked across the stage, picked the hat up from the floor, handed the hat to the speaker, and then returned to his seat. I don't know how many of the graduates caught it, but there was a lesson more valuable than anything any of them ever learned in most of their classes. This was genuine leadership in action.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-size: small;">Chairman Mao Zedong years ago published a pamphlet entitled, <em>Serve the People</em>. In America we still use the title "public servant" to describe our elected officials. I doubt if one in a hundred officials in either country - or in any country - actually sees himself first as a servant, and only secondarily as a leader. More the shame. I think the only person truly worthy to lead is one who seeks first to serve. Yes, I actually believe this. That is why I wrote all those character sketches in our soon-to-be-published textbook, <em>Speaking Beautiful English</em>. I genuinely believe that character is the most important thing we can teach anyone. And here was a graphic illustration of what I had been writing about.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-size: small;">There was another great university president who also set a marvelous example. He was also named President Lee. This was President Robert Edward Lee of Washington College, the same national hero who led my nation in its failed attempt to return to the independence it had once enjoyed. Anyway, back in the late 1860s President Lee was vacationing at a spa in the Virginia mountains. One evening there was a dance. Lee noticed a young lady who was being totally ignored by all the young men, and for no obvious reason. He inquired, and was told that the young lady's father was a damnyankee. Naturally, so soon after experiencing the devastation of invading northern armies, much bitterness remained in the South.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-size: small;">What Lee did next ranks as one of the greatest moments in the history of humanity. Lee asked this social outcast for a dance. The greatest hero of the South danced with the daughter of his former enemy. This action spoke louder than multitudes of lectures and sermons by legions of professors and preachers. Lee changed the life and fortunes of one young lady, and taught us all how to live better. Our own Sias University President Li likewise taught us a great lesson during our graduation ceremony.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-size: small;">I have attached at the end of this blog a link to a few photos of the graduation. I didn't bring my own camera, as I was busy lending dignity to the occasion with my University of Illinois doctoral gown with my non-regulation graduation cap. The photos mostly came from Amy's camera. They are random photos of students who wanted to pose with one or both of us after the ceremony. They represent not even 5% of all the photos taken at that time. The girl in the spectacular evening gown is Jodie, my former student who is heading to the University of Newcastle in England for graduate studies. I ate more than one meal at her house in Zhengzhou, or with her family at a Zhengzhou restaurant. She was one of my "inner circle." Joy was one of my more memorable students, too. The others already left for jobs in Shanghai or Beijing or elsewhere, and did not attend graduation. But at least you can get a glimpse of our graduation ceremony. The gorgeous lady in many of the photos, of course, is my wife Amy. I have no logical explanation as to how that happened.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Nanjing has a long and fascinating history, some of which is showcased in this and several other Nanjing photo albums on my website. When Zhu Yuanzhang (Emperor Hongwu, 1368-1398) established the Ming Dynasty, he made Nanjing his capital, built the city walls shown here, and built a palace which was later destroyed. The view of Xuanwu Lake Park was taken from the pagoda at Jiming Temple. Photos by Gary L.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I stumbled upon this museum by accident, but have always loved dinosaurs and almost majored in paleontology in college. However, I guess I just don't have enough faith to believe all the macroevolutionary dogma, especially after seeing too many evolutionists get creamed in debates with creationists who raised too many embarrassing questions. Some years ago the evolutionists circulated letters among university faculty advising them to stop debating, which tells me something about the quality of their "science." Photos by Gary L.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Hong Xiuquan led perhaps the largest peasant uprising in history, from 1850 to 1864. Claiming to be a younger brother of Jesus, Hong established his Heavenly Kingdom of Great Peace (Taiping Tianguo) in Nanjing. From there he sent armies to try to conquer the Qing Dynasty and establish himself as emperor. This quasi-Christian rebellion inspired numerous other uprisings, and left an estimated 20 million dead in its wake. Foreigners generally opposed the Taipings, in part because they outlawed opium and interfered with foreign profits. Photos by Gary L.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This memorial commemorates the 300,000 or so victims of a 6-week rampage by invading Japanese troops in Nanjing in 1937. Iris Chang's, <em>The Rape of Nanking</em>, is an excellent popular account of this forgotten holocaust of WWII. The museum contains many photos which have been published elsewhere, so I did not copy them here. But I have strong sympathies for the Chinese victims of this brutality, as members of my own mother's family perished in the Nazi holocaust at Auschwitz. As with the Nanjing Massacre, there is a company of fools who try to deny that this mass murder ever happened.  Photos by Gary L.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The Michael C. Carlos Museum is one of the best-kept secrets of great museum collections, although it did gain some fame recently for returning an important pharaonic mummy to Egypt. The collection is housed at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia. It has 5 main galleries of ancient artifacts which I have photographed and placed into 4 albums on my website. Three are from July, 2009; the fourth was added July, 2010. Photos by Gary L.

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[We the Carlos Docents have just discovered your image database of our collections. Thank you so very much! We have wanted to do something like this, but no one ever seemed to have the time. You did this in one day?! 
I have created a private web-site for the docent's and have placed links to your galleries, I also hope to make use of your images for our training purposes as needed. I read you have no problem of non-profit use. If you wish to access our site e-mail me and I would be happy to give you the user and passwords. Thanks again, Pat]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Teotihuacan (c. 200 BC - c. 600 AD) was once one of the largest cities in the world. It was given its name "City of the Gods" by the later Colhua Mexica (Aztecs), whose emperors made frequent pilgrimages. El Tajin was contemporary and perhaps related. It is located near Veracruz. Neither culture left a written history. I took the photos in spring, 2001. Photos by Gary L.

The Templo Major (Great Temple) was the site of thousands of human sacrifices to the war god Huitzilopochtli and rain god Tlaloc. Buried for centuries, it was rediscovered in the 1980s.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Tikal flourished in the Peten region of Guatemala from before 300 AD until nearly 900 AD when it was abandoned. It was possibly the greatest of all the Maya cities of the Classic Age, with a rich history recorded on stone monuments. Yaxha lies about 30 km from Tikal, but remains largely unexcavated, and has little known history. I took these photos in spring 2002. Photos by Gary L.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Chichen Itza &amp; Uxmal, in the northern Yucatan, were the two greatest Maya sites of the Post-Classic era. The temple of Kukulcan (probably Mayan for Quetzalcoatl) at Chichen Itza is perhaps the most famous pyramid in America. Historical records are generally lacking, but architecture is among the finest in ancient Mesoamerica. I took the Chichen photos in winter 2001 and the Uxmal photos one year later. Photos by Gary L.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Kabah, Labna, Sayil, &amp; Xlapak lie in the Puuc Hills of Yucatan, near Uxmal. They bear a distinct and highly ornate architecture called Puuc Style.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Mayapan has been called the last "capital" of the Maya, following the downfall of Chichen Itza. Buildings are of much poorer quality. It lasted less than a century and collapsed before the arrival of the Spanish. Tulum is a small, walled site, on the coast. Columbus probably saw lights from there when he passed by in 1502. The site was abandoned shortly afterward. El Rey is a late Maya village near Cancun. I took the photos in winter, 2001, except the Mayapan photos which I took in 2002. Photos by Gary L.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The Bishop Museum deals with early Hawaiian history. Pearl Harbor, site of a major U.S. naval base, is famous for the Japanese attack on December 7, 1941, which brought the U.S. into the Pacific War. Iolani Palace was the palace of the last Hawaiian kings &amp; queen, until the U.S. took over in the 1890s. These are all located in Honolulu, the capital of the islands. I took the photos in 2000 &amp; 2003. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of History, Sias International University, Xinzheng, Henan, China. <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/GaryLeeTodd/OahuBishopMuseumPearlHarborIolaniPalaceHonolulu">http://picasaweb.google.com/GaryLeeTodd/OahuBishopMuseumPearlHarborIolaniPalaceHonolulu</a>#]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[These photos were all taken on the "Garden Island" of Kauai, mostly showing beautiful scenery. Many were taken from a helicopter. Some of these sites should be familiar, as they were featured in a number of movies and television shows. I took the photos in 2000. I have additional albums for Oahu and Hawaii, the "Big Island."

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The Great Wall of China is credited to First Emperor Qin Shihuang (221-210 BC), who actually connected various local walls built by warring states over the previous 500 years. They were originally made of rammed earth. Over 1000 km of it was rebuilt to its present condition in the Ming Dynasty, c. 1500s, in the face of a Mongol threat. Unfortunately, much of it has fallen into disrepair again. These photos were all taken at Badaling in 2011, 2009, 2006, and 1991. Photos by Gary L.

Beijing is an incredible city, and these photos hardly do it justice. I got the train photos while stranded on the remnants of the Ming Dynasty City Wall waiting out the rain.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The discovery of this tomb in Xinzheng, Henan, in 1923, along with the later discovery of FuHao's tomb in Anyang, laid the foundation for Chinese archaeology. The main tomb belonged to a King of Zheng, dating to around 575 B.C. It contained two crane &amp; lotus hu vessels, arguably the finest bronze castings made anywhere in the world. Nine bronze dings indicate the tomb's owner claimed the title of king (wang) for himself. The original tomb contents are displayed at the Henan Provincial Museum and can be seen in several of my albums of photos from this museum. The artifacts shown here are reproductions.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In June, 1971, I began hitch-hiking across America from Phoenix, Arizona. This album shows the first part of my journey, from Tempe up to the Grand Canyon, where I hiked down the South Rim and up the North Rim before resuming my hitching-hiking. I spent a week at the bottom. Regrettably, I only had one roll of BW film for the whole trip. The color photos were taken from a jet while on my way to China in 1991. Photos by Gary L.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[From 1975 to 1979 I lived in Duluth, Minnesota, overlooking the entrance to the Duluth Ship Canal. It was easy to photograph the ships entering the harbor. The Duluth photos were all taken from 1976 to 1979. The earliest photos were taken with a half-frame camera. The prints were not very good quality, so the digital copies are also not so good. I have added a few river barges, as well as English Channel and Rhine River shipping. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of History, Sias International University, Xinzheng, Henan, China.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[My link to the old family photos is at the end of this essay.

A while ago I submitted DNA samples for a genealogical database. It prompted me to post my family information online for the benefit of anyone who is interested. I had done some research in this area when I was a graduate student, and thought that there might be others who would want to know what I learned. So I will post here what I can from memory. The bulk of my research is stored with my son in Texas. I plan to retrieve it this summer and add it to my website. In the meantime, here is what I know:<!--more-->

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Todd Family</span>:  Todds are originally Lowland Scots, from the border region between Scotland and England. Todd is an Old Scottish name meaning "fox." Old Scottish is actually Anglo-Saxon rather than Gaelic. In the 16<sup>th</sup> century we were probably mostly cattle and horse thieves. When John Knox brought the Reformation to Scotland, many Todds took to the Reformed faith and eventually became Covenanters. After the battle of Bothwell Bridge, Todds were sent on convict ships to Ireland or America. One James Todd was on board a convict ship which wrecked on the coast of Ireland. I suppose the Todds were transported to Ireland where they retained their Scottish heritage and the Presbyterian faith. I know we have always called ourselves Scots-Irish. Around the 1730s the first of my ancestors came to America, landing at Philadelphia, and heading down the Shenandoah Valley in Virginia, where according to oral tradition he already had some relatives. His name was James Todd and he had a son named James who fought with the Virginia militia at the Battle of Point Pleasant in 1774 during Lord Dunmore's War. That James Todd has his name engraved on the battlefield monument. He died in 1799 and left a will in the courthouse in Staunton, Virginia. He had four sons: George, James Jr., Nathan, &amp; Samuel. While James (d. 1799) is my great-great-great-great grandfather, I am not certain which of his sons my direct ancestor is. I have reason to believe it is George, as I know George had a James H. Todd and an Addison Todd as sons, and I know my great grandfather had an Uncle Addison. But three of the brothers had sons named James H. Todd, so there were three James H. Todds living in Augusta County, Virginia, at the same time. All were first cousins.

Regardless of who was his father, my great-great grandfather, James H. Todd, was born in 1817 and married Mary Henderson in 1842. She was not yet 14 when they married. My grandfather knew her as a child and says she was a very tall woman, while her husband was very short. Apparently she grew on him after marriage. They had 14 children. Their first was James Preston Todd, born 1845, my great-grandfather. James H. Todd disappeared around 1868, while carrying the payroll for the railroad. One theory is that he was robbed for the payroll. Another theory is that he was killed because he had been a damnyankee, and anti-yankee sentiment was still very strong in parts of West Virginia in those days. My personal theory is that he took off with the payroll and headed west, never to be heard from again. No one really knows.

James Preston Todd joined the 2<sup>nd</sup> West Virginia Volunteer Cavalry in 1863 when he turned 18. His father had tried to enlist, but was rejected for being too short. The rest of his siblings, except for brother Will, remained loyal to Virginia and the Confederacy. My grandfather once told me he had visited an aunt in Kansas City around 1905, and she had given him a tongue-lashing because of the treason of his father. James P. was once comparing notes with a neighbor who was a former Confederate, and they both agreed that during battles they fired high so as not to kill anyone. After the war James P. was a town sheriff or deputy. Once he caught a guy robbing a store and shot him dead. He was so sickened by that event that he turned in his badge and never again worked in law enforcement. He had a son William (who was struck by a car and killed in Rockford, Illinois, in the late 1950s) by his first wife. They also had a daughter Kate. After his wife died, he married Margaret Coulter, whose father and grandfather were both named Andrew Coulter. They had three sons: Virgil, Cecil, and Lloyd.

Cecil Amos Todd was born on May 1, 1890, and is my grandfather. Around 1900 the family moved to Illinois because it had better schooling. My grandfather graduated from high school in 1905 and went to work in the foundry. He worked in Canton, Illinois, for Parlin &amp; Orendorff, which I believe became part of International Harvester. He also became a lifelong Chicago Cubs fan, probably because they won the World Series shortly after the family moved to Illinois.

In Canton, the Todds were neighbors with the Witchers. Joseph Love Witcher had served in the 101<sup>st</sup> Illinois Volunteer Infantry. He was shot at Holly Springs and taken prisoner. The Confederate surgeon inserted one or two coins into his skull, which caused him trouble the rest of his life. Grandpa said his father-in-law had to live in a cabin in the woods sometimes to keep the sunlight from affecting the surgical implants. I believe he was exchanged after about six weeks or so. He was later offered a position in the Invalid Corps, which he rejected. (His documents were the inspiration for the article I wrote for <em>Civil War Times Illustrated</em>, which was published in December, 1985. Besides being paid for the article, I also received the Joseph Ward Swain Prize for best graduate student publication for that year at the University of Illinois History Department. I finished my Ph.D. shortly after the article was published.) It appears that his unit did provost duty in Atlanta, and had some responsibility for burning down the city. Family tradition claims also that Witcher was on hand at the liberation of Andersonville. Years later he was still haunted by the memories of the soldiers in the camp, although he probably didn't realize that their starvation was more a result of Lincoln's policies than anything the Confederates did.

Joseph Witcher was married to Talitha Sherrill, a descendant of Adam Sherrill who led the first white settlers into the Catawba River Valley in North Carolina in 1747, and who founded Sherrill's Ford. Extensive genealogical work has been done on the Sherrill family and has been published in at least three volumes. Talitha was the daughter of Isaac Sherrill and Keziah Bryant. Isaac had served with the 108<sup>th</sup> Illinois Infantry and had died during the Vicksburg Campaign. He was buried at sea, that is, in the Mississippi River. I heard once there was a newspaper article describing an explosion aboard a river boat and that it was this explosion which killed him. I cannot confirm this. Isaac was the son of Alexander Sherrill, who also appears on Illinois census records.

Grandpa married Joe Witcher's daughter, Iva Leola Witcher, in 1910. She had been born on May 8, just a week after he was born in 1890. They had five children: Mae, Dean (my father), Charlotte, Betty, and Robert, who died at about 18 months (probably from pneumonia). He later moved to Rockford, Illinois, where he and his brother Virgil were foreman &amp; assistant foreman at Rockford Brass works. He retired in 1967 at age 77. Grandma died in fall of that year, but Grandpa lived to almost 91. The fact that Grandpa Cecil was a master bronze moulder probably has something to do with my interest in ancient Chinese bronzes.

My dad was born October 30, 1916, and named Floyd Dean Todd. In the 1950s he legally dropped his first name and was known thereafter as Dean Todd. He worked as a machinist before starting college. World War II interrupted his college career, so he enrolled in flight training. He married my mom in 1942. They lived in Texas for the nearly two years of basic and advanced flight training. In 1944 he shipped out to England, where he flew the Republic P-47 Thunderbolt for the 9<sup>th</sup> Army Air Force. He flew 75 combat missions with the 389<sup>th</sup> Fighter Squadron of the 366<sup>th</sup> Fighter Group, earning several Air Medals and a Presidential Unit Citation for destroying 40 German locomotives in a 36-hour period. He flew close air support missions, destroying tanks, locomotives, and whatever else they could find on the ground. Once he blew up a facility for manufacturing rocket fuel. The Germans had disguised it as a hospital with a Red Cross prominently displayed on the roof, and all the way to the mission the squadron sweated over whether they would be killing patients or trashing a legitimate target. When they dropped their bombs, the "hospital" blew sky high, much to their relief. His good friend and wingman was Captain Lee Rorex, from whom I received my middle name. After dad passed away in 2000, Captain Lee sent me some short stories he had written about their combat missions. They are really good, so I will eventually put them up on my website.

After the war dad finished at the University of Illinois and did some graduate school, before taking a job as a newspaper reporter in New Castle, Indiana. Then he moved to Sterling, Illinois, where I was born in 1949. Then it was Belvidere, Illinois, where we lived at 1215 Whitney Blvd. In 1954 he took a job in Rockford, Illinois, with the Rockford Register Republic, where he became Business and Aviation Editor until his retirement in 1981. He wrote regular columns entitled "Flight Lines" and "Strictly Business." He went to Cape Canaveral to witness the space program, and broke his arm in a jeep accident covering the war games of the 101 Airborne Division's Operation Bright Star Pinecone III at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. He was a good friend of pioneer aviator, Bert R.J. "Fish" Hassell, and was the editor/writer of Fish's autobiography, <em>A Viking with Wings</em>. He was on the Greenland ice cap when Fish's airplane, the <em>Greater Rockford</em>, was recovered and brought back to Rockford. Fish and the plane had begun what was supposed to be a Great Circle Route pioneering flight from Rockford, Illinois, to Stockholm, Sweden, until the plane ran out of fuel. Fish and his co-pilot Shorty Powers spent two weeks on the icecap before being rescued. As a child, I spent a lot of time at Machesney Field and Greater Rockford Airport, while my dad was gathering information for his aviation articles. I also saw a lot of EAA Fly-In events at Greater Rockford Airport, before the Experimental Aircraft Association moved its annual convention to Osh Kosh, Wisconsin.

In 1983 dad suffered a massive heart attack while swimming at the YMCA. He was pronounced "dead on arrival" at the hospital, but they shocked his heart a number of times, and it finally worked. He lived another 17 years after that. All during his life he had been something of a religious skeptic. His near-death experience effected a major change in his life. He said afterwards that he no longer feared death. Even more amazingly, he joined the Presbyterian Church where he had been married in 1942, and faithfully attended right up to his death in 2000.

Even though I always thought of my dad as a hero for being a World War II fighter-bomber pilot, I think what I respect most is what he did near the end of his life. In the 1990s my mom became seriously ill. She was a brittle diabetic, and then contracted Alzheimer's Disease. Dad took care of her for several years, until just a week or two before her death in 1996. For any shortcomings he might have had in raising me as a child, he more than overcame them with this example. He was beginning to show the symptoms of Alzheimer's himself, when a heart attack took him away four years after mom's death.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Giertz Family</span>: The Giertz family comes from the village of Schlammern in Ost Preussen, about 8 or 10 km from the Baltic. East Prussia is now largely a part of Poland, Lithuania, or even Russia, and no one seems to know for sure exactly where the family lived. One of the "dirty little family secrets" is that "Grandma Adler" was a Jew. My mother was in contact with her great uncle, a composer, before the war, but that part of the family disappeared in the Holocaust, most likely at Auschwitz. Even though my mother had all the characteristics of a Jewish Mother, the family never talked about that part of their heritage. They only emphasized the German Lutheran Peasant part.

Theodor Giertz was a woodcutter on the estate of a German <em>graf </em>in Ost Preussen. His son, Frederick Christian Giertz, was born in 1853. He was a pacifist, and during the Franco-Prussian War (or shortly thereafter) he stowed away on a boat to avoid being drafted into the German army. He came to America by 1873, where he eventually settled in Champaign County, Illinois. He learned English by reading newspapers. He married Caroline Martens, daughter of Jacob Charles Martens. Caroline died in the great influenza epidemic in 1918 or 1919, but they had quite a few children before this. My grandfather, Alfred Albert Henry Giertz, was born in 1897. In 1919 he married Myrtle Letitia Nave, born in 1889, the daughter of James D. Nave and Martha Jane Redding. They had three children: Helen (born December 2, 1919), Mary, and Buddy, who died when he was around 14. Grandpa was a mailman before the war. He built a house on North Prospect Street in Champaign, Illinois, but the bank repossessed it during the Great Depression. He enlisted in the Army and volunteered to go to Germany as a German translator. But he was told they could not send him because he looked too Jewish, and might not be treated as a prisoner of war if captured by the Germans. (This is an intriguing anecdote in that it implies the U.S. had a far greater knowledge of the Holocaust than it admits.) He was later commissioned in the Adjutant General's Corps, and spent the war censoring mail. Sometime before the war he divorced my grandmother, which was a fairly unusual thing in those days. Later he married Bula, and after she died, he married Myrtle Green. He died in 1961 in Champaign, Illinois.

My mother, Helen Louise Giertz, was born on December 2, 1919, and grew up in Champaign, Illinois. She was accepted into college, but never attended. She met my dad when he was a student at the University of Illinois, and they got married in Rockford in 1942. She worked as a telephone operator when she was young, and was a professional seamstress most of her life. I was born in Sterling, Illinois, September 8, 1949. I had an older sibling who died two years before me, and my mother miscarried around 1957. So for all practical purposes, I was an only child. I wish I could have changed that. I got married in 1972 and had three sons: Nathan James Todd, born November 24, 1976, Marcus Preston Todd, born November 22, 1980, and Zachary Evan Todd, born December 9, 1983. In 2003 my wife left me to marry a man she met a year earlier on the Internet. I married Rosaminda (Amy) Aldemita Estrebilla on August 2, 2003, in General Santos City on the Philippine Island of Mindanao. She works with me in China, where I am a history professor at a university near Zhengzhou. <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/GaryLeeTodd/OldFamilyPhotos#">http://picasaweb.google.com/GaryLeeTodd/OldFamilyPhotos#</a>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Guo State existed in western Henan during Western Zhou and early Spring &amp; Autumn periods. The tombs of the king and his consort, discovered in 1990, were rich in bronze &amp; jade artifacts, and contained a large chariot burial. Guo State ended with the conquest by Jin in 655 BC. I've uploaded the full resolution of the bronze artifacts and chariots, but the rest I uploaded at a lower level. Poor lighting and/or thick glass made photography of the jade very difficult.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Xinzheng (where I have been living the last 5 years) is the birthplace of Huangdi and the type site for the Peiligang Culture. The artifacts from the tomb of the King of Zheng, discovered in 1923, formed the basis for the Henan Provincial Museum in Zhengzhou, and led to the birth of both modern Chinese museums &amp; modern Chinese archaeology. The bronze in this museum is all Eastern Zhou. The stone &amp; pottery which I labelled Neolithic is probably Peiligang Culture, and perhaps Yangshao, but I forgot to check the labels. I have additional albums featuring Xinzheng historic sites and the Henan Provincial Museum. Photos by Gary L.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Nanwan Lake near Xinyang City in southern Henan was created by a huge dam built in the 1950s. Jigongshan (Rooster Mountain) summer resort has over 200 villas built in many international styles of architecture. Jiang Jieshi (Chiang Kai-shek) built a bunker command center here during one of his encirclement campaigns against the Communists in the early 1930s. His wife Soong Meiling used the nearby dance hall. Unfortunately, I missed most of the beautiful scenery because of heavy fog. Photos by Gary L.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Dufu was an 8th century Tang Dynasty poet who lived 4 years in Chengdu while fleeing from the An Lushan Rebellion in the north. He built a thatched cottage and wrote many poems at a site which has been honored continuously to the present. In 1991 I visited the traditional site of the cottage. In 2001 workers discovered the foundations of Tang-era dwellings and recovered many artifacts which are now on display in a new museum, just a short distance from the traditional site. I've included displays and text which should provide more information about his life. Photos by Gary L.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This is one of five albums from this museum. It deals with ancient bronze from Sichuan Province. Artifacts listed as Warring States are from the Ba-Shu Culture. Because bronze is my own area of special interest, and because I want to better show the results of aging, I have uploaded this album with full resolution. Photos by Gary L.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Kaifeng was once the capital of Henan Province, and this was once the provincial museum. It still has a good collection of artifacts through the ages. However, the Kaifeng Jews exhibit on the 4th floor cost 50rmb and contained two illegible stones and a stone pot. That's all. And when we complained we had been robbed, the manager refused to refund our money. There is another private museum dedicated to the Kaifeng Jewish community which is much better. Photos by Gary L.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[A Jewish community has existed in Kaifeng for over a thousand years (some sources say over 2000 years). The Kaifeng Jews exhibit on the 4th floor of the Kaifeng City Museum cost 50rmb and contained two illegible stones and a stone pot. That's all. And I was not able to take photos. You may learn more about Kaifeng Jews at WWW.SINO-JUDAIC.ORG. The museum I show here is the private Shi Family Mini-Jewish Museum on Chinese Jews of Kaifeng. It can be reached at www.jewishchinatours.com. The family who runs it are direct descendants of the ancient Kaifeng Jewish community. Photos by Gary L.

		<title>EVIL WOMEN TYRANTS: Is History Telling Us the Truth?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This is the text of a talk delivered at a symposium at Sias University in May, 2010. I have tried to keep it simple, as the audience was made up of non-native English speakers. It's about women, but it's also about the uses and abuses of history, and about critical thinking. Historians have a responsibility for maintaining the highest level of integrity, and one of their greatest sins is to destroy another person's reputation. This essay is about two people who have been particularly maligned, and is an attempt to set the record straight. <!--more-->

I'm going to talk about probably the two most famous women in Chinese history – and the two most evil.
Wu Zetian &amp; Cixi
Wu Zhao (Wu Zetian) was a concubine of Emperor Tang Taizong (Li Shimin) (reigned 626-649 AD)
She captivated his son, the emperor Tang Gaozong (649-683)
She suffocated her own newborn daughter, accused the empress of the crime, &amp; then replaced her
She began to rule in the name of her husband, who was weak &amp; ill
She put her own supporters &amp; family in power &amp; brutally murdered her opponents
When Gaozong was paralyzed by a stroke in 660, Empress Wu dominated China until her death in 705
She had Gaozong’s wife, ex-empress Wang, and beautiful concubine Xiao murdered
She cut off their arms &amp; legs, &amp; threw them into a wine vat to die
She killed or exiled their supporters &amp; countless others
She murdered 12 branches of the imperial family
She created a secret police which ran a reign of terror
She purged the scholars &amp; killed or exiled them &amp; their families
She manipulated the succession after Gaozong’s death
She had the crown prince Li Hong poisoned
She had the other princes exiled
She had her 3rd son declared emperor
After just 6 weeks she had him charged with treason &amp; deposed
She then replaced Emperor Zhongzong with his brother Ruizong
For 6 years she treated Ruizong as a puppet
Finally in 690 she took the throne &amp; became China’s only woman emperor
She promoted herself as a deity &amp; took the title of “Sage Mother”
She made her lover the abbot of White Horse Temple
He rewarded Wu by finding the “Great Cloud Sutra”
This was a fake document claiming the Buddha Maitreya would return as a female deity
She established temples in every prefecture to preach this doctrine
She took the title of “Maitreya the Peerless”
She had the great stone buddha at Longmen Grotto carved in her image
She declared herself “Holy and Divine Emperor” of a new Zhou Dynasty
She took two young Zhang brothers as lovers
They bullied, got drunk, gambled, &amp; flouted all moral conventions
Bribery &amp; corruption ran rampant
Finally the Zhangs were assassinated &amp; Wu forced to abdicate
Her reign of tyranny and evil became a warning to future generations
At least this is the story that has come down to us in history
When you study history, you need to ask the question, “Who wrote the history?”
Why did they write it?
Who was paying them to write their history?
Why should we take their word for it?
“History is what historians say it is”
Historians have biases
Historians want us to believe what they tell us
History is always written by the winner
This is not only a Chinese problem
All countries everywhere use &amp; abuse history for their own purposes
All winners try to convince the world that they are right and good
All winners try to convince the world that their enemies are wrong and bad
Understanding these questions is the task of historiography
Historiography can be defined as the Philosophy of History, the History of History, or the Study of History resulting from a study of the historians who write the history
“All History is Historiography”
You cannot understand history unless you understand the people who wrote the history
Who wrote Wu Zetian’s history?
Confucian scholars who were employed by the government
That means they were in the service of the Li family (the emperor)
The Wu family had been their rivals
In 705 the Li family was the winner
Wu Zetian and her family were the losers
But also, Empress Wu was a woman
Women were not supposed to govern countries
This had never been done before – at least not openly
This violated the order of the universe
Naturally, she had to be punished
The best way to do this was to punish her reputation
Confucian historians told the world all about the evil reign of the tyrant Wu
Let’s examine Wu Zetian again
Under her reign China expanded to its great extent
She provided for the needs of the people
Her government was generally regarded as more successful than that of the Li family
Even though she persecuted high officials, she was generous to the lower ranks
Commoners were given the opportunity to work for the government for the first time
She gave promotions &amp; salary increases to her officials
She provided relief in times of famine &amp; natural disaster
So what do historians say about Wu Zetian now?
Most historians seem to think that her reign was fairly good for the common people
She was not a great ruler, but she was a good ruler
Did she do all those evil things the historians tell us she did?
Probably
But so did many or most emperors and kings in most cultures and countries
The historians only tell us the bad part of her reign
They overlook the good parts
So when we read about the evil tyrant Empress Wu, we must first ask ourselves, “Who wrote that history?” and then we must try to make a balanced view of her reign
There was definitely some evil
But there was also definitely some good

Now I want to say something even more controversial
This is not the stuff you learned in your history books
The information is relatively new, but I believe it is correct
Let us look at Empress Dowager Cixi – the “Dragon Lady”
She was concubine of Emperor Xianfeng (1851-1861)
She was mother of Emperor Tongzhi (1862-1874)
She was suspected of murdering the emperor
She was noted for violent rages
She supposedly had many lovers
She engaged in sexual orgies
She diverted state money into the Forbidden City
She diverted state money into the Summer Palace
Marble Boat was built with money stolen from the navy
Emperor Guangxu (1875-1908) was terrified of her
She held him as a prisoner in the Summer Palace
She crushed the “Hundred Days” reform movement &amp; killed its leaders
She encouraged the Boxers (Yihetuan) to destroy all things foreign &amp; kill foreigners
When the 8 Powers invaded China, she urged the emperor to flee &amp; murdered his concubine who urged him to face the enemy
She died in 1908, but not before she had the emperor killed to prevent him from pursuing more reforms
She had effectively ruled China for 50 years from “behind the curtain”
But is this the real woman people called the “Old Buddha”?
Our main source for the life of Cixi is Sir Edmund Backhouse
Backhouse wrote China under the Empress Dowager in 1910
He also wrote Annals and Memoirs of the Court in Peking in 1914
The first book went through 8 printings in 18 months
It was translated into many languages, including Chinese
It was used by both republican &amp; communist scholars for many years
These books provided all the shocking details of the depraved life of Cixi
Amazingly, only Backhouse seemed to know most of those details
But historians to this day continue to rely on his works
They largely ignore the letters &amp; diaries of many people who had far more first-hand acquaintance with Cixi than Backhouse ever had
These accounts nearly all portray a Cixi very different from the evil monster of Edmund Backhouse
So who was Edmund Backhouse?
In 1974 Hugh Trevor-Roper published Hermit of Peking: The Hidden Life of Sir Edmund Backhouse
He revealed Backhouse to be a counterfeiter, con man, and a complete fraud
Backhouse and his friends had supported themselves in Peking by forging and selling Chinese literary masterpieces, court papers, and court diaries
This was the material he used to fabricate his life of Cixi
If the source material Backhouse used was a fraud, then it follows that the two books he wrote based on that source material are also frauds
But people don’t want to think logically about this
They prefer the stories of sex, scandal, and evil which fill the pages of Backhouse’s books
After all, those stories are far more exciting
Backhouse understood his audience
England in the “Victorian Age” publicly thought of sex as evil, but privately were fascinated with it
Backhouse understood this and catered to their prejudices
His own history helps to explain his methods and motives
Backhouse had an unhappy childhood
He hated his mother, Florence
This probably influenced the hateful image he portrayed of Cixi
Backhouse squandered his inheritance trying to join Oscar Wilde’s circle of homosexuals
He fled England to avoid bankruptcy and ended up in Peking (Beijing) in 1899
He was, however, a genuinely gifted linguist
He translated documents for Morrison, the correspondent of the Times of London
In fact, he was probably the author of many of Morrison’s articles
But no one in Peking knew Backhouse supported himself by writing homosexual pornography
His obsession with pornography probably explains why the theme of sexual perversion underlies all his writings about Cixi
In 1943 he published his memoirs claiming he had a love affair with Cixi beginning in 1902 when he was 29 and Cixi was 67
He claimed his first orgy with the Empress took place at the Summer Palace
He claimed he had some 200 sexual encounters with Cixi until her death 6 years later
He also claimed many hundreds or even thousands of love affairs with men
Backhouse’s memoirs are full of pages of pornographic depictions
They are also totally improbable
But his image of Cixi is useful
A thoroughly evil Empress of China helps to justify the genuinely evil actions of Western imperialists in China at the turn of the 20th century
One rule of history: always make your enemy or your victims look as evil as possible
This makes your actions appear to be just and good
Remember this fundamental rule of history:
The winners write the history
The winners in 1900 blamed the invasion of China on the evil folly of Cixi
To this day, this is the version taught in textbooks
But if we examine the historical sources, we discover that Westerners shot hundreds of Chinese before the siege of Peking began
It appears that the Westerners provoked the war, rather than the Boxers
And it was the foreigners who pillaged and burned the Hanlin Library
That atrocity has always been blamed on the Chinese
Again, Morrison’s stories based on Backhouse’s forgeries form the basis for our interpretation of the “Boxer Uprising” and the entire era
Backhouse gave us a false picture of Cixi, but he also gave us a false picture of China and of many other historical events
People believe them because they want to believe them
Unfortunately, they are largely lies
Scholars are beginning to discover the truth about Backhouse and his work
But many people oppose these new scholars
The works of the older scholars are based on Backhouse, and if Backhouse is proven wrong, then their own works are discredited
But now we know that Backhouse was a liar and a fraud
Has anyone tried to re-examine the life of Cixi by using sources besides Backhouse?
Yes, in 1992 Sterling Seagrave published a book, Dragon Lady: The Life and Legend of the Last Empress of China
He sought out the sources that most historians have ignored for the last century
He gave us a very different image of Cixi
Cixi was not perfect – she really did have a bad temper – but she appears to be far more human
Emperor Guangxi was not terrified to be around her
She did not engage in wild orgies – no concubine would have had such freedom
She did not squander vast sums of money – that was done largely by the Manchu princes who actually did rule
And many people who actually met her found her quite charming
Much more can be said, but it should be clear that you cannot always trust the official history
“History is what historians say it is”
If the historians are not telling the truth, then the history cannot be trusted
Lesson to be learned: Don’t believe everything people tell you
Don’t believe everything you read
Think – and critically examine all relevant pieces of information
If you want to be a leader, you must have correct information before you can lead]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The Mawangdui Tombs in Changsha are one of the world's greatest archaeological treasures, due to an incredible degree of preservation. Over 3000 cultural relics have come from the tombs: pottery, lacquerware, food items, textiles, and an almost perfectly-preserved corpse of a noble woman who died over 2100 years ago. The bamboo and silk texts are the world's oldest copies of many ancient works, and in many cases, the only copies. The many labels I've included should provide considerable detail about the tomb and its contents. This display is part of the Hunan Provincial Museum. Photos by Gary L.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I have long studied and taught history. I have been very good at seeing the details, but have generally missed the broader themes which help one to better understand and interpret those details. I’ve seen the trees, but I have missed the forest. Recently I have begun to see the forest, and, seeing it, have begun to make some sense out of many things I had never before understood or had chosen to ignore.<!--more-->

The basic understanding is really quite simple:  Rich and powerful people work hard to further their own interests. That is, they work hard to gain more riches and power. They collude with other rich and powerful people, and generally trample on the lives of those who are not rich and powerful. Some people call this a conspiracy view of history. For the sake of argument, I shall use the term conspiracy and attempt to show how it helps explain the major events of history. At the onset, I will note that some of these ideas are tentative and subject to clarification and correction. But the overall theme is, I believe, sound.

Let’s start with economic panics, recessions, and depressions, since we are currently (2010) in the midst of a serious one. I’ve never liked to study or even think about economics before, but I think one must, if one would understand the driving forces of history. I had always accepted the view that these evils were accidents, or part of impersonal cycles. They just happened, and there was nothing much anyone could do about them. I knew how J.P. Morgan had “rescued” the United States economy in the Panic of 1907, and that he had made a tidy fortune doing so. It never occurred to me that he might have been the one who caused the panic in the first place. Yet that is pretty much what happened. In fact, I would say now that every one of those economic disasters was to a large extent planned and promoted, because the same group of bankers and economic powerbrokers always came out richer than ever when things returned to “normal.”

So who has all this economic power? Bankers, mostly, and not just your little local bankers, but those who control the powerful banks whose clients are the nations which have borrowed from them to finance their wars, social programs, and anything else the bankers have contrived to drive them further into debt to themselves.

At this point I must introduce the Rothschild family, a name central to all modern conspiracy theories. The first ancestor of this banking dynasty, Meyer Amschel Bauer, discovered back in the 1700s that he could make far more money by lending to nations than he could by lending to farmers. Bauer, who later changed the family name to Rothschild for the Red Shield that hung over the door of his business, became good friends with a German prince and made a fortune handling his finances. He also made a fortune renting German soldiers to the British to help suppress the American Revolution. (The prince pocketed the money and left the soldiers dead, stranded in America, and/or unpaid.) Rothschild had five sons, and put each in charge of a large national bank in England, Austria, France, Italy, and Germany. It was Nathan Rothschild in England who made the most of this, though all the family continued to amass untold billions over the years.

During the wars of Napoleon in the early 1800s, Rothschild banks operated a courier service which was able to pass easily through enemy lines. This gave them access to crucial intelligence, often before the military or the governments knew what was going on. This was one key to their success. Another was that Rothschild banks were financing both sides of the war, and were obviously delighted the longer the war continued, and the more the belligerent nations piled up debts. But the economic coup for Nathan Rothschild came with the Battle of Waterloo in 1815. Rothschild couriers informed Nathan of Wellington’s victory over Napoleon a day or so before anyone else in London had any idea of the outcome. Nathan shrewdly walked into the financial exchange looking like he knew England had lost. The stock market plummeted. As stocks dropped in price, Rothschild agents quietly bought them at a fraction of their former prices. When the official couriers reported that Wellington had won and that Napoleon was finished, the stock market soared, and Rothschild made a fortune. I think today we would call that something akin to “insider trading,” which is both illegal and unethical. Whatever the case, he amassed a huge profit at the expense of other people whom he had duped.

That’s one key point about rich and powerful conspirators:  They have no moral scruples. They answer to no higher authority, and they do whatever they can get away with to increase their wealth and power. What the history books usually ignore is the fact that their wealth comes from the impoverishment of other people. They don’t create wealth, they don’t make our lives better, they don’t provide work for people, except in a peripheral sense – they only transfer wealth from productive people to themselves.

Waterloo was a very good start for Rothschild banks, and they only got richer over the next two centuries. One sore spot was the United States. Rothschild tried to create a national bank in the U.S. under his control. Americans twice chartered a national bank, and twice they let its charter expire. Thomas Jefferson and Andrew Jackson vigorously fought the imposition of a national bank. Indeed, the first assassination attempt on a U.S. President was a failed attempt against Andrew Jackson. It is quite likely that the assassin was an agent of the banking interests. Abraham Lincoln later issued money without the use of a central bank, which certainly made the international bankers furious. Some serious scholars have suggested that the real reason for his assassination was his refusal to follow the dictates of the central banking interests, although this probably can never be proven one way or the other.

At one time we thought the massive J.P. Morgan interests were strictly American. Morgan supposedly never did business with Jews (Rothschilds were at least nominally Jewish, although I doubt if any of them ever took the fundamental tenets of Judaism seriously). That was a masterful hoax. We now know that Morgan was directly tied to Rothschild interests. Essentially he was one of a number of “front men” who operated secretly on behalf of the Rothschild banks. One thing historians have failed to do in American history is to “follow the money trail.” Apparently it is a taboo topic. No one will ever get tenure or retain any serious teaching position if he talks about Rothschild banking influences in American history. Yet that is precisely where the money trail leads. Of course, one can make a convincing case that our entire public education system is under their control, which explains the wall of silence. People with this much wealth and power rarely want the public to be aware of their wealth and power.

I used to think that our economic policies were the result of stupidity. I don’t think so any more. Nor do I see the real debate as between Democrats and Republicans or Liberals and Conservatives. The bankers appear to be in control of both political parties and both liberal and conservative think tanks. They created the great stock market crash of 1929 and the resulting Great Depression, while the New Deal played perfectly into their hands by the government contracting billions of dollars of loans. This is a key point. Debt is good for the banks. The banks own the debt; hence, they own the country. The more debt, the better it is for the banks. Wars, deficit spending, and massive waste are all good for the banks. So the policies I formerly thought were the height of stupidity, I now believe to be brilliant – both brilliant, and evil. Massive waste means massive loans, and even greater power for the banks. So it’s no accident that we can spend tens of thousands of dollars for a toilet on an Air Force transport.

I think all of our modern wars have a Rothschild connection. I know that European interests were positively delighted when the War Between the States (erroneously called a “civil war”) threatened to break up the United States of America. Of course there were causes pretty much unique to America, but there were also foreign bankers pushing things in the direction of war. Conspiracies are seldom perfect, and often are but one part of a bigger and more complicated picture. What I realize now is that they are a very big part of most major events, and that this particular conspiracy has continued to manipulate world events for more than two centuries.

The Boer War was quite obviously a Rothschild grab for the gold and diamonds of South Africa. The victims were the Dutch Boer farmers, to whom the official histories have not been particularly kind. As an aside here, the diamonds were not particularly valuable in themselves. They make excellent industrial cutters, but the demand for industrial diamonds is not all that high. So to make diamonds more valuable, the diamond merchants created a false need. Ivy Lee, who remanufactured the reputation of fellow Rothschild collaborator John D. Rockefeller from an avaricious monopolist into a benign uncle dispensing shiny dimes to poor children, was the genius behind the diamond hoax. He engineered the campaign to make every woman in the world insist she had to have diamonds with such slogans as “diamonds are forever,” and “diamonds are a girl’s best friend.” That campaign raised the demand for diamonds along with their price - that plus the fact that hoards of diamonds are intentionally kept off the market in order to maintain an artificial scarcity. If diamonds were sold on a free market with prices that reflect their intrinsic value, prices would fall drastically, along with the profits of jewelry dealers.

The two world wars, however, are probably the most egregious and flagrant examples of the exercise of raw power to serve the interests of the International Bankers and those of the arms manufacturers they control. Rather than continuing to focus on the Rothschilds as the villains of history, let’s broaden this to the World Order, or the New World Order. They are mainly different names for the same phenomenon, but I think World Order gives a better idea of their motives and ultimate plan for us. Rothschilds are key players, but by no means the only ones. Conspiracies evolve over time. Players come and go, and sometimes form rival conspiracies. I believe the idea of one all-powerful conspiracy in absolute control of all the major world events is probably a myth. But there is nevertheless a relatively well-defined group of families which have wielded considerable political and economic power throughout the western world for at least the last two centuries.

When I was a graduate student, my professor of European Diplomatic History taught me the “Galloping Gertie” model of the origins of the First World War. Galloping Gertie, the Tacoma Narrows Bridge, was a suspension bridge which opened in 1940 and tended to rise and fall when caught in a crosswind. Four months after completion the wind got so bad that the bridge literally tore itself apart. Once the bridge had started to sway in the wind, internal forces caused the undulations to steadily increase in intensity until the final disaster. So it was in Europe in 1914 that secret treaties and mobilization plans set in motion a chain of events which no one could stop once the process had begun. Nonsense!

Again, follow the money trail. Rothschild banks financed both sides of the war. When Germany appeared exhausted and starving and threatened to end the war before America got involved,  Herbert Hoover, who almost certainly was tied to the Rothschilds, was appointed to set up the Belgian Relief Commission, ostensibly to feed the starving Belgians, but in reality to feed the starving Germans (and apparently also, the Russians, at least after the Bolshevik Revolution). The war was deliberately prolonged to increase the profits of the arms merchants. The U.S. was enticed into the war through a series of frauds, though things did not always work according to plans. The <em>Lusitania </em>was sunk in 1915, but failed to arouse American pro-war sentiment to the point of commitment. The Zimmerman Telegram was almost certainly a British forgery (Rothschild agents, almost for certain). And, by the way, Wilson’s 1916 campaign slogan, “He kept us out of war,” was the height of hypocritical deceit. Wilson had long planned for the war, and for its hoped-for consequence of creating a One World Government. Therein lay the heart of the conspiracy. The war was managed to maximize profits, but even more so, to bring the world into a New World Order. That has been the primary goal of the conspiracy from the beginning. But this attempt failed, so a second world war was contrived.

I used to think that the Treaty of Versailles was one of the stupidest and most malevolent treaties ever perpetrated upon the world. I missed the big picture. The treaty guaranteed a second world war, but that was not an accident. It was all part of the plan. But back to the First World War.

The Rothschilds had long hated the Romanovs, the Russian royal family, whom they helped to overthrow in 1917. No informed person believes that the Russian Revolution was a spontaneous uprising of the downtrodden masses. What’s interesting about the Romanovs, though, is the enormous wealth they had deposited in Rothschild banks before the war. With the family wiped out, guess who got to keep those billions? And guess which banking family still has all of them? A couple of claimants to the Russian throne did arise some years later. If they could prove their claims, they could claim those billions. The traditional view is that they were frauds. This is possible. But the British Lord Mountbatten, a relative of the Romanovs and a Rothschild agent, went to a lot of trouble to fight one of those claimants in a British court. This is not the conduct one would expect of a British lord toward an obvious fraud.

We have long known that American capitalists had financed the Bolshevik Revolution and had repeatedly bailed out the USSR when it was frequently on the verge of collapse. Most people – myself included - have just wondered why capitalists would spend their resources to preserve their avowed enemies, the communists. Again, follow the money trail. The Cold War was another managed conflict, where the real power behind both sides was the International Bankers. Since the ultimate goal is One World Government with them in control, communism provided a useful model of how to proceed. I don’t think any of the World Order ever actually believed in communism. But it proved useful to their ultimate ends. Not only did it provide a model for total control over a population, but it also provided another opportunity for massive rearmament and massive profits for the arms merchants.

While Liberals had been the most useful allies of the World Order in demanding increased government spending during the Great Depression, Conservatives proved their most useful allies during the Cold War. They took the leadership in demanding increased military spending and promoting military ventures around the world. I’m not so sure that the demise of communism was totally planned, though. I tend to think the system just did not work because it was based on bad economics and a faulty view of human nature, and that the World Order had not actually engineered its collapse. Conspiracies do not always go according to plan. What does seem to go according to plan is their amazing resiliency to change tactics when unforeseen changes do occur. We no longer have the fearsome specter of communism to terrify us into massive military spending and into giving up our liberties in the name of security. We now have Islamic terrorism. And while Islamic terrorism is real, it is also something that conspirators have played a major role in creating and encouraging.

The CIA has been a major player in all sorts of conspiracies. I was once courted by recruiters from the Intelligence Community, so I did some homework and asked a lot of questions. I believed they were genuinely patriotic cold warriors, which is probably generally true. What I didn’t know then, but know now, is that the predecessor OSS was largely a creation of British Intelligence in World War II, and that British Intelligence was largely managed by – no surprise here – Rothschild interests. I had long wondered why so many communists or “fellow travelers” served in the CIA in the early years. I think the answer is obvious now.

What I found particularly shocking was that General George Patton – one of my heroes - was assassinated by the CIA (technically, at that time, the OSS). Bill Donovan himself ordered Patton’s murder to, in Donovan’s words, “save him from himself.” Apparently Patton knew too much about Allied complicity in giving Eastern Europe over to the Russians, and about Eisenhower’s possible role in the matter. Had he retired, he would have been compelled to remain silent. So instead, Patton threatened to resign his commission and expose what he viewed as treason. To prevent this, Donovan ordered one of his top operatives, Douglas Bazata, to do the job. In 1979 Bazata publicly admitted before a banquet hosting several hundred people that he had set up the auto crash, which had actually been minor. Then he shot Patton with a low velocity round, breaking Patton’s neck. But Patton refused to die, and began to make a remarkable recovery. The murder itself took place in the military hospital, when an NKVD (predecessor to the KGB) agent was allowed inside to administer a fatal injection of cyanide. All this is readily verifiable – no conjecture on my part here. Bazata took a stress test, or polygraph, and passed with flying colors.

But the strange death of America’s first Secretary of Defense James Forrestal is a little more problematic. The official view says he committed suicide by jumping out a 16<sup>th</sup> floor window while confined to Bethesda Naval Hospital for “mental illness.” Highly unlikely. He almost certainly was murdered. The only real question was who did the murder. Some think communist agents, while others think the Mossad, as Forrestal was an avowed enemy of both communism and Zionism. (Another view suggests a more personal motive.) Senator Joseph McCarthy, who also died in the same hospital, quite possibly was murdered as well. People in high places who know too much and threaten the World Order frequently end up dead. The rest are written off as cranks, mentally unstable, and “conspiracy nuts.” Once you can apply a label (like “racist” in other contexts), that pretty much ends all rational discussion.

I must also introduce General Smedley Butler, who coined the expression “gangster for Wall Street.” A Marine two-time Medal of Honor recipient, he should have become the Commandant of the Marine Corps. He had been involved in every U.S. Marine action from the Boxer Punitive Expedition (Eight Power Invasion) of 1900 to multiple invasions of Latin American countries which were about to default on their loans to International Bankers. He spoke out, and it cost him his career. Later in life he admitted that his military career had been one of mostly being an enforcer for Wall Street. He also noted that the Great War had largely been a war for the profits of arms merchants.

The Korean War introduced a new twist. For the first time American soldiers were fighting for an international organization, the United Nations (the next attempt at creating a World Order after the failure of the League of Nations). A major goal of the World Order is to break down loyalty to God, the family, and the nation, and replace it with unquestioned obedience to the new Masters. This was a major step. While American generals still directed the war effort, the groundwork was being laid for American soldiers to fight for an organization other than the United States of America. I had long thought that it was a fortunate coincidence that the Soviet Union had been boycotting the U.N. Security Council at the time the vote for war was taken, and that the Soviets had stupidly missed their opportunity to stop this war by using their veto power. Again, I missed the big picture. Their absence at that key vote was planned all along. The entire war was managed by the conspirators. No U.S. national interest was at stake here, and there was never a declaration of war by Congress. It wasn’t even a proxy war between communists and capitalists. It was a managed conflict controlled by the people who controlled both the communists and capitalists.

The label “capitalist,” however, is not accurate here. The World Order is not made up of true capitalists. Capitalists thrive on competition. Competition forces capitalists to improve their products and sell at lower prices. Consumers benefit. The world bankers don’t want true competition. They want a monopoly, with themselves as the monopolists. That is why so much legislation in America today targets small businessmen, the only true capitalists. A major goal of the World Order is to destroy the middle class. So again, our anti-business laws are not just a matter of stupidity and corruption. They reflect a conscious attempt to destroy the nation’s only truly free enterprises and take them over by the powers of monopoly and World Government.

Vietnam was yet another controlled war in which no national interests were at stake, and where victory was not allowed. It represented a betrayal of America’s own heritage as a nation founded on the overthrow of colonialism. President Roosevelt, before he died, stated that he had no intention of helping the French reclaim their old colonial empire after World War II. Yet within a year of his death United States ships ferried a French army back to Indochina and indelibly painted the U.S. as a bulwark of dying colonialism. Over the next three decades, nearly everyone who knew anything about Southeast Asia counseled America to stay out of its internal affairs. To make matters even more interesting, our chief adversary, Ho Chi Minh, had been trained by the OSS during World War II.

Vietnam is probably too personal for me to write objectively about it. But for the sake of this essay I will resurrect two things which particularly bothered me at the time, apart from the whole business of killing people and making body counts. One was the tanker ships off Cam Ranh Bay. They came in riding high in the water, anchored off shore a few kilometers, and sat there. A day or two later they departed riding low in the water. I have always thought there were underwater pipelines filling the ships with oil, though I have never been able to confirm my suspicions. I think many of us believed at the time that the war had something to do with oil.

Even more sinister, though, were the shipments out of Long Chen Airbase in central Laos. I believe that Long Chen was the busiest airport in the world, though almost no one had ever heard of it. It was an Air America field, that is to say, a CIA operations base. Tons of “smack” (the word we used at the time for heroin) were shipped out of there on Air America transports. The explanation we heard was that opium was the cash crop of our Montagnard friends, whose help we needed in interdicting supplies shipped down the Ho Chi Minh trail to Viet Cong operating in the south. We needed their good will, so we graciously helped them market their “crops.” The result was a massive amount of drug use among American GI’s by the late 1960s. Though I personally never shot smack, I know a few guys who did, and roomed with one who became a severe addict.

So who profited from all this? Probably the CIA. Certainly Marshall Nguyen Cao Ky, the head of the government we were fighting for. But ultimately, I’d bet it was the bankers again. Back in the early 19<sup>th</sup> century those same families were reaping huge profits from the misery of the Chinese people. The Opium Wars were one consequence. President Franklin Roosevelt’s own father was born in China because FDR’s grandfather was an opium smuggler. A list of the major opium-smuggling companies reads like the list of directors of Rothschild-controlled enterprises. So the World Order has made drug trafficking a major part of its criminal operations. Small wonder that the big pharmaceutical companies are all controlled by the same gangsters.

The Gulf Wars – well, suffice it to say that the Bush family has for several generations been major players in the international World Order cartel. There is already much information available connecting three generations of Bushes with Arab oil, Halliburton Industries, and Planned Parenthood. This essay is not meant to be definitive. Many serious researchers have delved far deeper into this stuff than I have. I’m basically a history teacher who was looking for a deeper and more accurate understanding of the way things are. Since I’m interested in many more things than just historical conspiracies, I leave more in-depth study to the specialists.

There is one more area I wish to mention - foundations and education. The Foundations, that is, the tax-exempt “charitable” foundations, are central to the World Order’s recruitment and indoctrination. All such foundations, conservative or liberal, are run by the same elite group. This should tell you that the real issue in the world is not the battle between Democrat and Republican, between Liberal and Conservative, but, rather, between the World Order and those who would be free. None of the charitable foundations actually engage in charity. They are a means whereby the superrich can maintain their empires without paying the taxes they expect the rest of the people to pay. And they are a means of recruiting the next generation of technocrats who will carry out their orders. Quite possibly, an occasional bright star might even make his way into the inner circle of the ruling elite, someone heretofore unknown like, perhaps, an Obama.

But even more importantly, the foundations shape public policy and educational policy. It is not an accident that the most famous of these foundations – Carnegie, Ford, Rockefeller – are all major contributors to Big Government organizations and scholars, and to those who advance the agenda of the World Order. It is all a matter of controlling populations.

George Orwell’s classic book, <em>1984</em>, is an excellent study in totalitarian world orders. Ironically, I had always thought he was warning people of the future in the hands of the World Order. This is probably at least partly true, but in fact, Orwell seems to have been somewhat sympathetic to their motives and methodologies. His book may not have been so much a warning of how to avoid but rather, was a statement of how things will be under the Order. The unspoken advice is that we had all better submit because there is nothing we can do about it.

But is there nothing we can do? As I understand it, one of the biggest obstacles to the World Order’s plan to control the world, is America’s Second Amendment and some 200,000,000 firearms in private hands. America’s Founding Fathers had created the Second Amendment as the basis for the protection of the liberties of the First Amendment. Government was created by the people in the interest of the people, and was to be severely limited in scope and power. Knowing that government would sooner or later abuse its power, responsible citizens were to be armed so that the government would fear to take away the liberties of the people. This is the greatest single obstacle to the World Order, and the reason why gun control is so prominent in their agenda.

Population control. Planned Parenthood is heavily subsidized by the World Order. It was created out of the Eugenics Movement in the early 20<sup>th</sup> century. Margaret Sanger, its founder and close collaborator with Prescott Bush, promoted birth control in order to limit the size of the population of the “lower races.” It’s no accident that today Planned Parenthood does most of its business in African-American neighborhoods. What is frightening is the often-repeated goal of the World Order to reduce the world’s population to about one billion, about what it was in the early days of the Rothschild Empire. Some sources say a half billion, while Bill Gates, I believe, stated he thought that the goal should be two billion. While Gates said he merely wanted to let the population decline through non-replacement of existing people, one frequently encounters speculation about genetically-engineered diseases, experiments on controlling weather, volcanoes, and earthquakes, and the likelihood of a third world war. Some World Order folks apparently don’t want to wait for natural attrition.

I always used to list Rachel Carson among the great mass murderers of the 20<sup>th</sup> century. Of course, that was mostly hyperbole to emphasize a point. The author of <em>Silent Spring</em> certainly had no desire to murder millions. Carson’s premise that thin-shelled eggs would lead to the ultimate extinction of birds was largely “junk science,” but was a major factor in the U.S. campaign to eliminate DDT. As a direct consequence of its worldwide ban, millions have died needlessly from malaria and other mosquito-borne illnesses. Scientists themselves are now arguing for a re-evaluation of DDT policy. Again, I used to think this was merely another example of monumental stupidity, or greed on the part of manufacturers of the inferior and expensive chemicals which replaced DDT. I missed the point. Most of the victims come from Africa, a main location of the more “expendable” of the world’s surplus population. I think this also explains why world leaders generally sit by idly while Africans commit genocide upon each other. It fits the agenda. (I’m aware also that many people think AIDS was engineered similarly to reduce the supply of Africans.)

Needless to say the whole Global Warming scare is a scam. There is no Global Warming, or at least nothing which can be proven to result from human causes. There are only the natural fluctuations of the world’s climate. One of the biggest problems for Global Warmers is the fact that the earth’s temperature was considerably higher from about 800 to about 1300 AD than it is today. There were no hydrocarbon emissions to blame then. The last two winters and the exposure of the East Anglia Climate Research Center internal memos have helped to demonstrate the fraud here. Global Warming is not about science. Global Warming is about control and about wealth transfer. Frightened people readily give up their liberties to those who promise to take care of them and/or protect them from real or imagined dangers. When I started college, we were all taught that the earth was entering a new Ice Age. Naturally, if people are the reason why we have destroyed the environment, then limiting the number of people is essential to the preservation of the environment.

Problems. People who understand something of the conspiratorial nature of the New World Order, or whatever it is called at any given time, will be marginalized. Educators, academics, and those with vested interests will ridicule such people as “conspiracy nuts,” or perhaps as mentally unstable. That is the external threat. The internal threat is that many people who study conspiracies are genuinely nutty. Moreover, there is often an overlap between genuine understanding of the machinations of the ruling elites, and racist reductionism. Anti-Semitism runs rampant through the conspiracy writings. This is almost certainly because the Rothschilds and many of their allied banking partners are Jews and major supporters of Israel. But I doubt if many of them are real Jews in the sense that they read and follow the Torah. It is grossly wrong and unfair to paint all Jews as contributors to the World Order because many of its leaders are nominally Jewish. Websites which feature generally accurate studies of the World Order all too frequently contain racist diatribes and Holocaust-denying theories. It’s difficult for the uneducated, or the barely educated, to make the distinction between unorthodox views of history which are accurate or at least reasonable, and unorthodox views of history which serve no greater purpose than hate-mongering.

What makes matters more confusing is that the Holocaust-denial industry and many of the conspiracy theories are being promoted by radical Islamists. During World War II the Nazis recruited their SS Handschar Divisions from Muslim communities by appealing to a common hatred of the Jews. Former Nazis and their sympathizers led the way in trying to deny that Germany had murdered millions of Jews (the exact number murdered, does, however, remain a legitimate ground for discussion and difference of opinion). But today, when one navigates the labyrinth of conspiracy and Holocaust-denying theories the trail almost invariably leads back to the Middle East. The current leader of Iran is one of the more public deniers of the Holocaust and one of the most eager to place the blame for all the ills of the world on the International Jewish Conspiracy. This should serve as a serious warning about conspiracy theories in general. But guilt by association does not negate the fundamental premise that genuine conspiracies exist in the world. It should come as no surprise that one of the more popular conspiracy scenarios of the 9-11 attack on the Twin Towers and the Pentagon portrays the perpetrators as agents of Israel’s Mossad. One group claims that Mossad agents murdered the 19 Mohammedans before the hijacking and used their own agents or drugged dupes to take over the four airliners and crash them into the buildings. While this is theoretically possible, it is highly improbable.

What, then, should we think about 9-11? I used to think that those who believed in the theory of thermite-induced destruction of the World Trade Towers were a bunch of wackos. But answer this question:  Who has benefitted from 9-11? The Patriot Act was a massive step away from freedom and toward the consolidation of power by the World Order. Either they were extremely lucky in being able to capitalize so quickly upon a tragedy which just happened to take place without warning, or some of them were complicit in one way or another. Certainly there are issues demanding a genuine explanation. One curious piece of evidence which does lend credibility to the Mossad theory of Twin Tower destruction is the film of Israeli agents dancing in glee and pointing to the burning Twin Towers. After that film was made they were quickly whisked out of the country. Perhaps this has been already explained – I am not obsessed with conspiracies and have not done an exhaustive analysis.  By itself this episode probably means nothing, but I remember the 1967 Israeli attack on the <em>USS Liberty</em> which was deliberate, pre-meditated, and repeated, and resulted in the deaths of dozens of American sailors. Cover-up would be a euphemism.

It is certainly possible that a fuel-laden jumbo jet could bring down a skyscraper. But the collapse of all three buildings really did look more like controlled demolition than anything resulting from a plane crash. I think some engineers have given a satisfactory explanation regarding the collapse of the two Twin Towers, but then there is the troubling issue of the collapse of WTC #7. This was not even hit by an airplane. Many other skyscrapers have burned without collapsing, and yet 3 WTC towers collapsed after being hit by 2 aircraft. I’m not satisfied with official explanations. Not long ago I stumbled upon the wreckage of the Mandarin Oriental Hotel in Beijing. It is a gutted mess, thoroughly burned from top to bottom. Yet it is still structurally stable. Are the Chinese much better engineers than Americans, or is the explanation to be found elsewhere? I understand, though, that some of the fault may be of our own doing, in that EPA regulations prohibiting the use of asbestos in construction may have been a major contributing factor in the buildings’ collapse. Even if events transpired exactly the way the official version claims, the government is certainly doing a poor job of making accurate information available, and thereby lending credibility to the most extreme of the conspiracy theories.

This essay is not meant to be definitive. It raises more questions than it answers. Far more detailed information and analysis can be found on a multitude of websites and in dozens of books. My purpose is mostly to stimulate thinking and questioning of the traditional and/or official explanations. This is partly a confession of my own past gullibility in accepting uncritically the “facts” I was taught in school. My considered opinion is that understanding the conspiratorial nature of powerful elites goes a lot farther toward understanding the workings of history than does the alternative view that most everything happens by chance.

A final observation:  Conspiracy enthusiasts often talk about the satanic nature of the World Order. The Illuminati and the Masons figure prominently into most conspiracy theories, and generally in the context of some satanic plot. Some theories trace the World Order back several thousand years to ancient Babylon. Whatever is the precise role of the Evil One, the Illuminati and Freemasonry are historical organizations with a track record of secrecy and intrigue. At least some of what has been written about their role in World Order conspiracy intrigue is true. Some, however, is problematic. But one thing that I read about the Great Deceiver in a different context struck me as profoundly relevant. When Jesus was fasting in the wilderness, Satan tempted Him with worldly power and wealth. “All these kingdoms of the world I will give you,” he said, “if you will only bow down and worship me.” Jesus refused. Maybe, just maybe, the New World Order elites have so much wealth and power today because they accepted the offer.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This album contains the jade gallery of the Shanghai Museum. Unfortunately, harsh museum lighting makes jade the most difficult artifact to photograph, and many of these shots are not very good. Hopefully they will give an idea of the quality of workmanship anyway. Also, not every object here is true jade, but I didn't have time to write everything down, so I will call it all jade. This is one of at least six albums I've created for the different galleries of the museum. Check the "Shanghai" tag to find the others, or look for postings from August, 2008. Photos by Gary L.

		<title>Speaking Beautiful English</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Why another book on how to learn English? That’s a great question! The answer:  The best written and designed ESL books must accurately ask and answer these three main questions:<!--more-->

How can we get the students to like the material?

How can we get the students to understand the material?

How can we get the students to remember the material?

This book excels in all three. Through a multi-faceted approach to language learning, each student will have a great time learning it, an easier time comprehending it, and more effective way of retaining it. It is a communicative, values-based, integrated-skills (listening, reading, and speaking) approach to learning how to SPEAK the language. It is designed to guide the teacher in presenting interesting English and then giving the students a chance to practice and create with it.

The unique, straight -<strong>A</strong>- features of this book are:

<strong><em>A</em></strong> communicative, values-based, integrated skills (listening, reading, and speaking) approach to

learning how to speak the English language and understand C.U.L.T.U.R.E.

<strong><em>A</em></strong> modern language book that teaches students how to speak contemporary English, including

the sharpening of their listening, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills.

<em> <strong>A</strong></em> unique student-centered approach that is easily received, understood, and remembered by

using a presentation, practice, and production format.

<strong><em>A</em></strong> course that will develop character and leadership qualities and improve the pronunciation and

conversational skills of each student, making them into successful, confident English speakers

and young, world-class business professionals and educators.

At the same time, one must remember that the secret to learning a language is not learning a lot and practicing a little, but learning a little and practicing a lot! Like learning how to play ping pong, one must not only watch good players, but also pick up the paddle and start to play. <em>Learning a language is more like playing a sport than studying history</em>. A Chinese proverb says, “Tell me, I'll forget. Show me, I may remember. But involve me, and I'll understand.”<strong> </strong>It doesn’t mean one shouldn’t be diligent in his study; only that YOU have to DO IT to be good at it! Like learning how to play a sport with the coach explaining, demonstrating, and then watching the players do it, so should language be taught.

Moreover, like being an excellent athlete, the language learner must be intrinsically motivated with constant attention to improving his skill. Be careful, however, not to think that experience is the best teacher. Like a coach with his team, guided experience is the best teacher. One must do the right thing in the right way over a long period of time. This is the best chance for success in ESL acquisition and in any field, for that matter.

Finally, as necessary for all great education (knowledge, skill, <em>and</em> character), this book is also about how to grow in our understanding of the basis of all successful living, in our personal or corporate life. This foundational and primary principle on which all others build on is this character trait called <strong><em>integrity</em>:</strong>

<strong><em>Consistently making righteous choices, based on the right moral and ethical principles.  Complete or “whole” - not divided - holding firm to what you believe is right, and acting upon it. Making your behavior consistent with your beliefs, even when nobody is looking.</em></strong>

In order to meet this goal, you will find here a well-organized, guided structure, yet, at the same time, one that allows you the freedom to have fun with it. It consists of 26 topics with each topic divided into six sections. They are as follows:

<strong><em> </em></strong>

<strong><em>The Character Corner (Part 1):</em></strong> A values-based reading section, introducing the reader to great men and women throughout world history who have proven themselves to be outstanding citizens, improving the daily lives of their countrymen and beyond. Who doesn’t want good character? This section gives the reader a chance to practice his listening, reading, and fluency skills. Exploring a highly-interesting subject, he will also have many opportunities to develop critical thinking skills through the insightful questions at the end of each section.

Please remember, however, that all human beings are flawed. No one lives up to the expectations of others. No one even lives up to the expectations they set for themselves.

Many of the greatest people in history have had some of the greatest character flaws. In this book we have tried to choose people who exhibit a high level of character. We have tried to give examples of people who might serve as role models. In one sense, this is an impossible task. A careful study of the lives of these role models will reveal flaws. Each person we have presented as a role model has failed at one time or another. This is the human condition. We cannot find a perfect person, because perfect people do not exist in the real world.

But this does not mean that we cannot find good role models. There really are heroes in the world. The heroes are generally ordinary people who have overcome great challenges. They have struggled with the same temptations and failings as the rest of us. But they persevered. They refused to be defeated, and in the end, they did something which made the world a better place.

Most of us will never be mentioned in the history books. But all of us have the opportunity to influence the course of history. Every day we make choices. These choices make us the people we are. These choices determine our character. We will affect the lives of others. When our choices are good, we will benefit others and make the world a better place. It is our hope to encourage each of you to begin by thinking good thoughts. These thoughts will lead to good words. These good thoughts and words will lead to good actions. These actions will become habits. These habits will become our character. Our character will be the most important legacy we leave to our descendants, and to all of humankind. This section will help us learn from history. This is because one thing we learn from history is that humankind doesn’t learn from history; therefore we repeatedly make the same mistakes. Let us benefit from the lessons of history.

<strong><em>The Character Corner (Part 2):</em></strong> A section to teach timeless truths that transform people into becoming responsible and respected citizens. This book not only will define the meaning of real integrity, but also explain how to become people of solid virtue by providing easy-to-follow action steps. There’s another Chinese proverb that says, “It takes ten years to grow a tree, but a hundred years to bring up a generation of good men.” Integrating character into learning will “grow” a strong generation that will bring honor to family and country for years to come. <em>Speaking Beautiful English</em> is about creating beautiful speakers - from the inside out. In order to achieve this we have added a <strong><em>“Living It Out”</em></strong> section that gives real-life examples of college and career men and women who have lived by these virtues and have succeeded. For further conversation practice in this section and other ones we have also included a <strong><em>“Let’s Talk About It”</em></strong> component, which allows the students to talk about what they had just learned from the traits and human interest stories.<em> </em>

<strong><em>The Culture Corner:</em></strong> A section to teach students the importance of cultural awareness and understanding others’ cultural “grids” in both social and business interaction. We define culture as:

<strong>C</strong> ommunication (shared/passed down) within

<strong>U </strong>nified group of people - the

<strong>L</strong> anguage,

<strong>T</strong> raditions, and

<strong>U </strong>nderlying beliefs and values within

<strong>R</strong> elationships/behavior and the

<strong>E</strong> nvironment (social institutions)

Language is best learned within the framework of culture in order for it to be accurately understood and effective. We call this language usage.  Also, language reflects culture.  For example, in one language, the same word means “thin,” “weak,” and “sickly.” This is because the people of this culture equate thinness with weakness and lack of good health.

<strong><em>The Conversation Corner: </em></strong> A section to improve the students’ conversational skills in contemporary, everyday speech on the street, at home, in school and the workplace.  Since motivation is a major key to learning, we must design a curriculum that meets felt needs. This activity contains relevant topics based on the everyday life of a college student. It also uses other real-life dialogue from the business world. In this way the students will be able to remember more of what they learn because of it being directly applicable to their lives. There is a Chinese proverb that says, “An oil lamp becomes brighter after trimming, a truth becomes clearer after being discussed.” This corner will give much opportunity for discussion, producing greater understanding and fluency. These essential 25 communication skills are needed to improve your “serve” on the “court” of your business platform. We communicate in only four ways: <em>By what we do,</em> h<em>ow we look, what we say,</em> a<em>nd how we say it.</em> This section will focus on developing the latter two.

<strong><em>The Career Corner:</em></strong> A section to teach students some fundamental principles of succeeding with colleagues and supervisors on the job. Students will learn how to work together with others in the job culture and overcome the challenges that await them in the marketplace. How will they be able to persist in reaching the zenith of their career? This section offers much proven advice from the experts in the field, including real life examples of these principles and leadership qualities necessary for successful work.

In this section and others there are many opportunities to practice this useful and modern language through fun and effective activities (partner work, group work, games, music, drama, discussion, debate, and other activities). As mentioned already, after most of the corners there are the “<em>Talking About It”</em> and “<em>Living It Out”</em> sections. These real-life anecdotes and activities act as great conversation starters, touching both the mind and heart of the student. These essential components will help each student to use his imagination, solidifying what he learns into long-term memory, paying heavy attention to building fluency with functional English.

<strong><em>Connection Corner: </em></strong>A section to help the student to understand what is the most appropriate thing to say in a particular situation, for example, how to show sympathy, share one’s opinion, disagree, and get to know others better. Also, telephone etiquette, how to lead a business meeting, and how to improve one’s listening skills, are just a few of the many different and practical tips on having a great conversation with someone from <em>any</em> culture. In this part you’ll find the most common, modern, and thorough examples of what to say in many different situations in your work or recreation. This up-to-date section will give anyone the best view of how things are said…TODAY!

<strong><em>Construction Corner: </em></strong>This section attempts to cover some of the most basic grammar structures that one should know to be a fluent English speaker. Although the primary purpose of this book is not to focus heavily on grammar (there are already many good books written on the subject), it does help the speaker review and <em>remember</em> the basics. In this part we have combined some of the best ESL drills and skills to help the student understand and REMEMBER some essential grammar. Here you’ll find some clear and simple explanations of some of the most difficult tenses, phrasal verbs, prepositions, etc.

Keep in mind that the goal of language is communication. One university student was asked why she liked studying English. She said, “Because I can communicate with foreigners in their own language.” We talk and listen (along with non-verbal cues) in order to share our thoughts and feelings and hear the thoughts and feelings of others from their heart language. Effective communication means that everyone involved will understand and be understood, receive and be received, remember and be remembered. What, then, is the ultimate goal of communication? Although communication involves a cognitive process, its goal and context are primarily social. We communicate to develop a relationship with someone through an exchange of information between the messenger and the receiver. Even conducting business or doing research with another person involves some level of relationship.

Relationship, or the interest in one, directly affects our motivation for learning a language. For example, a boy who never had any desire to learn English can suddenly become very motivated when he meets an English-speaking girl he likes who can’t speak his language! Or a student wanting to study abroad in France will do all he can to learn enough French to pass the required exam and live there. Likewise, even those who haven’t met someone yet or don’t have any particular plans will still be motivated to learn the language(s) of (a) culture(s) they enjoy and admire.

Moreover, as we have seen, greater motivation leads to greater and more effective language learning.  This, in turn, leads to better communication, then relationships (social, business, etc.), and so on, until we’ve come full-circle. The means and methods of this book help to keep these wheels of the learning cycle moving smoothly. This cycle will not only develop better knowledge and skill, but also character, which must go hand in hand with the best educational experience.

Learning a foreign language within one’s own country can be a daunting task. Many don’t have the opportunity to travel to the country where the native language is spoken. It’s easy to become discouraged and give up, disappointing those who want you to succeed. However, as Einstein once said, “Try not to become a man of success, but rather, try to become a man of value.” The authors hope this book will make it easier and more effective for those who wish to become competent men and women equipped with a good mind <em>and heart</em>, ready to serve and improve the lives of their families, country, and the world.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The area around Nanyang in Henan Province is rich in fossils, and especially dinosaur eggs. The park was built at a site where eggs are excavated and features a tunnel into strata with dinosaur eggs in place. An on-site museum displays many eggs, most of which were found near Nanyang. It appears that there will be more added to the park in the future. Photos by Gary L.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Wuhan, situated where the Han River joins the Chang Jiang (Yangtse), was originally 3 cities: Wuchang, Hankou, and Hanyang. I made 7 photo albums from the fabulous collection of the Hubei Provincial Museum, but have added this 8th album of several other historic and scenic places in the city. Most of the pictures are of historic Yellow Crane Tower, plus some from the Guiyuan Temple built in the early Qing Dynasty. Photos by Gary L.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We start with the Paleolithic culture of Yunxian Man, although I am highly doubtful of what anthropologists claim about early human history. Next we have the exhibit of the Neolithic culture of Qujialing. We end with the Shang Dynasty culture of Panlongcheng, which confirms that the Shang culture of Yin (Anyang) of the Central Plains reached all the way south to the Yangtze Valley. This is one of 7 albums I've created for this provincial museum. Photos by Gary L.

	<li>Developed in response to desires of people</li>
	<li>2 parties today</li>
	<li>Minor parties exist, but not normally important</li>
</ul>
Democratic Party
<ul>
	<li>Oldest of America’s two major parties</li>
	<li>Was the conservative party in 19<sup>th</sup> century</li>
	<li>Effectively removed conservatives by 1970s</li>
	<li>Promotes liberal social programs like food stamps, cash payments to mothers, subsidized housing &amp; medical care</li>
	<li>Promotes big government &amp; high taxes</li>
	<li>Controls all government education (public schools &amp; universities)</li>

</ul>
Republican Party

	<li>Became conservative party in 20<sup>th</sup> century</li>
	<li>Traditional belief in limited government, individual responsibility, low taxes, strong national defense, tough policy against crime</li>
	<li>Falsely labeled as party of rich, but under Reagan became popular with working people</li>
	<li>Strong appeal to thinking people &amp; tendency to practice reasoned debate</li>
	<li>In recent years the two parties have tended to adopt similar practices &amp; beliefs</li>
</ul>
America’s Political Parties
<ul>
	<li>Politicians receive high salaries, excellent retirement benefits, &amp; many other advantages</li>
	<li>Congress is exempt from Social Security it forces all other people to pay for</li>
	<li>Goal of most politicians of both parties is to get elected and keep getting re-elected</li>
</ul>
Principle of Federalism: American government operates at different levels

Each state has its own government

United States Economy
<ul>
	<li>Large land mass &amp; good climate</li>
	<li>Abundant natural resources</li>
	<li>Relatively small population</li>
	<li>Protestant Work Ethic &amp; an economic system which rewards hard work &amp; thrift</li>
	<li>(last point may be questioned today, but it was true in the past when America was becoming a world superpower)</li>
</ul>
Economic System:

Capitalism (free enterprise, market economy, or supply side economics)
<ul>
	<li>Private ownership of property a fundamental right</li>
	<li>Based on ideas in Adam Smith, <em>The Wealth of Nations</em>, 1776</li>
	<li>In practice, a mixed economy with elements of capitalism &amp; socialism</li>
	<li>Similar to Britain (and China)</li>
	<li>Underlying principle of capitalism: Entrepreneurs pursuing self-interest benefit everyone</li>
	<li>Example of Bill Gates</li>
	<li>Today, a <em>mixed economy</em>, with elements of capitalism &amp; socialism</li>
	<li></li>
</ul>
<em>Laissez-faire</em> (government does not interfere in economy):
<ul>
	<li>Thomas Jefferson: “That government is best which governs least.”</li>
	<li>Traditional American value still taught in school</li>
	<li>American history has witnessed continuous growth of government and gradual loss of freedoms</li>
</ul>
American Industry
<ul>
	<li>Much of America’s wealth is due to the fact the U.S. avoided the destruction of two world wars</li>
	<li>The problem is that America continued to use factories built in the 19<sup>th</sup> century</li>
	<li>Nations destroyed in WWII were able to rebuild with new, modern factories</li>
</ul>
Types of Businesses:

Proprietorships
<ul>
	<li>Owned by individual or family</li>
	<li>Owner liable (responsible) for all debts</li>
	<li>Today about 17 million proprietorships</li>
</ul>
Partnerships
<ul>
	<li>Owned by small number of people</li>
	<li>Risk and profits are shared</li>
	<li>Today about 16 million partnerships</li>
	<li>Proprietorships &amp; partnerships are called “small businesses”</li>
	<li>Both types are popular with people who want to “be their own boss”</li>
</ul>
Corporations
<ul>
	<li>Usually called big business</li>
	<li>About 2% of all business, but 90% of all business income</li>
	<li>Many investors (owners of stock)</li>
	<li>Liability limited to value of stock</li>
</ul>
Role of Government in Business:
<ul>
	<li>Almost none in 19th century (<em>laissez-faire</em>)</li>
	<li>Today the government</li>
	<li>- protects rights of workers</li>
	<li>- protects consumers</li>
	<li>- prevents monopolies</li>
	<li>- fights for American industry in world market</li>
	<li>In practice big business and allies in government pass laws &amp; taxes aimed at limiting competition by small businesses</li>
	<li>Example: minimum wage laws appear to try to help the poorest workers, but in fact they cost thousands of jobs of the least skilled and the young – such laws mainly buy the votes of workers who want to eliminate competition</li>
</ul>
<strong>Principal American Holidays</strong>

Christmas (December 25): celebrates birth of Jesus Christ (most important holiday)
<ul>
	<li>Celebrating Christmas was outlawed in 17<sup>th</sup> century Massachusetts because it is not found in the Bible</li>
	<li>By 19<sup>th</sup> century it was America’s most important holiday</li>
	<li>America turned away from its Christian roots in the 20<sup>th</sup> century</li>
	<li>Today it is illegal to celebrate Christmas on public property</li>
	<li>Today “Happy Holidays” has replaced “Merry Christmas”</li>
	<li>But Christmas is still the most important holiday</li>
	<li>Merchants do 50% of their yearly business during the month before Christmas</li>
	<li>Christmas is the time to spend money for presents, and for families to get together</li>
	<li>Christians still celebrate Christmas as the birthday of Jesus</li>

	<li>Today it is officially ignored or prohibited</li>
	<li>Christians still celebrate Easter privately</li>
	<li>The decline of Easter reflects the growing anti-Christian attitude of the political and educational elites</li>
	<li>Muslim holidays are beginning to be celebrated in public schools</li>
</ul>

British policy toward colonies:  “Benign Neglect”
<ul>

	<li>Labor shortage contributed to freedom &amp; resulted in almost classless society</li>
	<li>In 1763 British colonists in America were proud to be part of the British Empire</li>
	<li>This feeling would change very quickly</li>
</ul>
<strong> </strong>

<strong>Lecture IV.  American Revolution, 1763-1783</strong>

<strong> </strong>

Colonial America, 1607-1775

¨  2 centuries of neglect allowed American colonies much freedom

¨  Democratic institutions slowly emerged

¨  Colonists grew increasingly critical of governors appointed by King

¨  1735: John Peter Zenger arrested for publishing article critical of Governor of New York

¨  Zenger tried for libel

¨  Defense attorney argued his writing was true &amp; he should be acquitted

¨  Colonial jury agreed &amp; acquitted Zenger

¨  Established principle that truth was a sufficient defense for libel (If it’s true, you can’t convict a person of libel.)

¨  Landmark trial in history of freedom of the press

<strong>More Underlying Problems</strong>

¨  Mercantilism: the theory that colonies exist for the benefit of the mother country

¨  Theory led to series of acts to benefit England at the expense of America

¨  British acts forbade colonies to manufacture iron, hats, &amp; molasses because they competed with the mother country

<strong>Navigation Acts</strong>

¨  British Navigation Acts required all goods shipped to England &amp; her colonies to be transported in English ships

¨  Acts required all shipments to go through England first, to provide jobs for British dockworkers &amp; to make it easier to tax

¨  Americans resisted British laws and became proficient smugglers

<strong>Conflicts Leading to Independence</strong>

¨  Threats to colonies: Spanish in Florida, Indians in the West, &amp; French in Canada &amp; the West

¨  Four colonial wars resulted

¨  French &amp; Indian War, 1754-1763, last and most important colonial war

<strong>1763: Treaty of Paris – British Empire doubled in size</strong>

<strong>Problems Resulting from French &amp; Indian War</strong>

¨  Large British debts from war

¨  Problem of defending colonies from French &amp; Indians

¨  1763: Pontiac’s Uprising – massacres on frontier

¨  British response: Proclamation of 1763 forbade colonists from going farther west

¨  Many investors angered because they owned land west of Proclamation Line

¨  British need for new revenue led to new taxes

¨  British stationed troops in colonies for defense – seen by colonists as threat to liberty

Sugar Act, 1764

¨  Tax on all sugar entering colonies

¨  Britain sent customs officers to collect taxes

¨  Ordered governors to enforce laws against smuggling

¨  Accused smugglers tried by judge rather than by jury

¨  British officials given power to search suspect’s house without search warrant

Stamp Act, 1765
<ul>
	<li>Tax on documents &amp; printed matter</li>
	<li>Radical opponents of Stamp Act organize as Sons of Liberty</li>
	<li>Sons of Liberty protest; boycott British goods; riot against stamp tax collectors &amp; destroy house of Massachusetts governor</li>
	<li>“No taxation without representation”</li>
	<li>Tax repealed</li>
</ul>
Boston Massacre
<ul>
	<li>March, 1770, Boston, Massachusetts</li>
	<li>Soldiers fire into crowd; kill 5</li>
	<li>Sons of Liberty claims British plot to destroy colonial liberty</li>
	<li>Paul Revere propaganda: p. 278</li>
</ul>
What really happened
<ul>
	<li>Underpaid British soldiers took second job at docks</li>
	<li>Colonial dockworkers angered by competition</li>
	<li>Drunken crowd attacks off-duty British soldiers</li>
	<li>Throw snowballs, excrement, bricks at British</li>
	<li>About 200 colonists against 20 British</li>
	<li>British disorganized; panicked; fired in fear</li>
	<li>Paul Revere drawing pure propaganda</li>
</ul>
Very effective propaganda: we still publish that picture today

Boston Tea Party, 1773

¨  New taxes led to new protests

¨  British repealed taxes, except tax on tea

¨  Price of tea actually lowered in effort to help East India Company

¨  Tea became symbol of British “tyranny”

¨  Sons of Liberty dressed as Indians boarded 3 British vessels in Boston Harbor &amp; destroyed tea in protest of “tyranny”

British response to Destruction of Tea:

¨  British responded with 4 Coercive Acts

¨  Port of Boston closed until colonists pay for tea

¨  Massachusetts legislature suspended

¨  British soldiers quartered in private buildings

¨  British soldiers accused of colonial crimes to be tried by home country, not in colony

¨  Unrelated act: Quebec Act organized Ohio River area, making it hard for New England to expand there

¨  Colonists call all 5 acts the “Intolerable” Acts

¨  Colonists saw Acts as plot to destroy colonial liberty

¨  First Continental Congress met in Philadelphia to plan strategy: formed first inter-colonial government

¨  Massachusetts legislature met illegally at Concord

British get tough

¨  British fired Massachusetts colonial governor

¨  Replaced governor with Army general

¨  British plan to seize colonial weapons &amp; arrest legislature at Concord

¨  Paul Revere &amp; others warn Minutemen

Minutemen hastily form line at Lexington: troops face each other on town square

“Shot heard round the world”

¨  No one knows who fired the first shot

¨  British continued on to Concord: another battle

¨  Failed to find arms or colonial leaders

¨  British returned to Boston

¨  Colonial snipers harass “redcoats” all the way home; many casualties

<strong>Lecture VII.  War Between the States and Reconstruction</strong>

Principles of History:
<ul>
	<li>The winner of the war writes its history</li>
	<li>Winners are always right</li>
	<li>Winners always claim their cause is just</li>
	<li>Losers are always wrong</li>
	<li>Winners always make the losers look as bad as possible</li>
	<li>This is true of all nations, all cultures, and all time periods of history</li>
	<li>The North won the “Civil War”</li>
	<li>The North wrote its history</li>
	<li>The North gave the war the title “Civil War”</li>
	<li>By definition, there was no “civil war” in America</li>
	<li>A “civil war” is when two sides fight to control the country</li>
	<li>Historically correct terms include: War Between the States; War for Southern Independence; or War of Northern Aggression</li>
</ul>
Slavery
<ul>
	<li>Some people claim the war was about slavery</li>
	<li>This is partly true, but misleading</li>
	<li>Lincoln did not start the war to end slavery</li>
	<li>Lincoln promised to leave slavery alone to “die a natural death”</li>
	<li>Lincoln ended slavery only after he was losing &amp; needed support of the English</li>
	<li>Black African slavery has existed for over 2000 years</li>
	<li>Spanish imported African slaves long before English colonies did</li>
	<li>90% of all African slaves went to Latin America &amp; the Caribbean, not U.S.</li>
	<li>Northerners from New  England (not Southerners) transported all the slaves from Africa to America</li>
	<li>1619: 1st African slaves (20) in Jamestown</li>
	<li>Slaves were sold at auctions</li>
	<li>Slave marriages were not recognized</li>
	<li>Children of slaves became slaves</li>
	<li>American slavery was based on race</li>
	<li>Slaves were considered property with no legal rights</li>
	<li>Slaves were kidnapped in Africa by other African tribes and by Muslim slave traders, then sold to Yankee slave traders</li>
	<li>Most slaves were NOT physically abused; they were valuable property</li>
	<li>Average slave lived 9-10 years longer than the average free white worker in the North</li>
	<li>Average slave ate 900 calories of food per day more than the average free white worker in the North</li>
</ul>
Cotton gin
<ul>
	<li>Patented in 1793 by Eli Whitney</li>
	<li>Cotton gin made slavery more profitable</li>
	<li>1 slave could now do the work of 20</li>
	<li>Cotton became a valuable cash crop</li>
	<li>Southern plantations began to expand as a direct result of the cotton gin</li>
	<li>Slavery had been dying out before 1793</li>
	<li>Afterward it began to expand</li>
	<li>Southern economy became based on cotton</li>
</ul>
Southern slave-owners
<ul>
	<li>90% of all Southerners owned NO slaves</li>
	<li>Most slave-owners owned 5 or fewer slaves</li>
	<li>Fewer than 200 families owned gangs of 100 slaves or more, but these large plantation owners owned about ½ of all slaves</li>
	<li>Slaves in plantation gangs lived in separate slave quarters</li>
	<li>Other slaves shared the master’s house, ate with his family, and were usually considered as members of the family</li>
</ul>
Economic exploitation of the South
<ul>
	<li>Since the 1790s Northern capitalists taxed Southern planters to finance building of Northern factories</li>
	<li>90% of all taxes were paid by the South</li>
	<li>Northerners received most of the benefit of taxes on Southern agriculture</li>
	<li>Karl Marx correctly stated that a principal cause of the “Civil War” was economic oppression of the South by the North</li>
</ul>
Slave &amp; Free states
<ul>
	<li>Free   states: North; slavery outlawed</li>
	<li>Slave states: South; slavery legal &amp; vital to economy</li>
	<li>Equal numbers of each in Senate</li>
	<li>Missouri Compromise, 1820: Missouri slave state; Maine free state; preserved balance in Senate &amp; prevented conflict</li>
</ul>
Mexican War
<ul>
	<li>1848 treaty gave northern 1/3 of Mexico to U.S.: Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, California, Utah, &amp; more</li>
	<li>Mexican Cession became battleground in growing struggle between free &amp; slave states</li>
</ul>
Northern Strategy:
<ul>
	<li>North wanted to expand number of free states until ¾ of all states are free states</li>
	<li>North would then have enough power in Senate to end slavery by Constitutional amendment</li>
	<li>North must prevent Southern expansion</li>
</ul>
Southern Response:
<ul>
	<li>South must expand slavery to protect itself from growing power of North</li>

	<li>China trade spurs plans for transcontinental railroad</li>

	<li>Act violated Missouri Compromise – both Kansas &amp; Nebraska lie in territory forbidden to slavery under 1820 Compromise</li>
	<li>Kansas becomes battleground: “Bleeding Kansas”</li>
	<li>Republican Party started by people angered by Kansas-Nebraska Act</li>
</ul>
<em>Uncle Tom’s Cabin</em>
<ul>
	<li>1852 novel by Harriet Beecher Stowe</li>

	<li>Made many Northerners angry at South</li>
	<li>Made Southerners feel their culture was being condemned by North</li>
	<li>Made compromise increasingly difficult</li>
</ul>
Abolitionists
<ul>
	<li>People who wanted to abolish slavery immediately &amp; refused to compromise</li>
	<li>Fewer than 5% of Northern population</li>
	<li>Saw abolition as moral issue and compromise as weak &amp; immoral</li>

	<li>North &amp; South no longer trust each other</li>
</ul>

	<li>Didn’t need Southern votes to get elected</li>
	<li>1860 election extremely divisive</li>

</ul>

	<li>Clinton won Presidency with 43% of vote</li>

	<li>Clinton tried to smear reputations of people he illegally fired</li>
	<li>Illegally acquired FBI files</li>

	<li>Clinton illegally used him for personal legal services</li>
	<li>Foster committed suicide</li>
	<li>Clinton operatives illegally seized Foster’s files and took them to the White House</li>

	<li>TV networks all declared Gore the winner – before the polls had closed!</li>
	<li>Violation of ethics &amp; previous promises</li>
</ul>
American media tried to promote Democratic victory
<ul>
	<li>CBS claimed polls closed one hour before they actually closed</li>
	<li>This caused many voters to stay home</li>
	<li>Heavily Republican districts were most affected</li>
	<li>Bush won anyway</li>
	<li>Al Gore demanded recount</li>
	<li>Bush won recounts – all of them</li>
</ul>
Gore’s attempt to steal election
<ul>
	<li>Al Gore still refused to concede election</li>
	<li>Compare with 1960: Nixon confronted with clear evidence of Democratic fraud refused to demand recount because he didn’t want to cause division in America</li>
	<li>Gore demanded additional recounts, but only in areas which favored Democrats</li>
</ul>
Election taken to U.S. Supreme Court
<ul>
	<li>Florida Supreme Court granted Democrats illegal extension for more recounting</li>
	<li>U.S. Supreme Court ruled that Florida must follow the law &amp; not Gore’s demands</li>
	<li>Democrats &amp; media claimed Bush “stole the election”</li>
</ul>
“The Big Lie”
<ul>
	<li>Any lie repeated loud enough and often enough will be believed by many</li>
	<li>For over one year Democrats tried to find ways to prove they won the election</li>
	<li>They failed</li>
	<li>But liberal media and academia still make false claims that Bush “stole the election”</li>
</ul>
Terrorism
<ul>
	<li>Religious fanaticism (mostly Muslim) replaced Communism as threat to world peace</li>
	<li>America main target, but not only one</li>
	<li>Clinton bombed Iran to divert attention from his impeachment</li>
	<li>But Clinton had the opportunity to kill Osama bin Laden &amp; refused to do so</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Sept 11, 2001: World Trade Center destroyed by hijacked aircraft</li>
	<li>Pentagon damaged</li>
	<li>President Bush began war on terror</li>
	<li>War in Iraq &amp; Afghanistan</li>
</ul>
American foreign policy since World War II
<ul>
	<li>Contrary to U.S. Constitution &amp; advice of George Washington</li>
	<li>Arab world hates America because they see Americans as foreign invaders</li>
	<li>America’s wars &amp; social spending have created massive debt</li>
	<li>Bush friends appear to have made great profits with Gulf War</li>
</ul>
Bush II Administration
<ul>
	<li>George W. Bush one of least popular Presidents</li>
	<li>War on terror led to invasion of Iraq &amp; Afghanistan</li>
	<li>Motives for war unclear or misleading</li>
	<li>War very unpopular, but no new terror attacks</li>
	<li>Massive spending programs &amp; corruption exposed near end of Presidency</li>
</ul>
Warning
<ul>
	<li>It is too early to make fair &amp; adequate assessment of Bush Presidency</li>
	<li>Most sources not yet available to scholars</li>
	<li>Most opinions based on information provided by media</li>
	<li>Media mostly controlled by Democrats (enemies of Bush – 89% admitted they voted for Gore)</li>
</ul>
Barack Obama
<ul>
	<li>Bad economy always favors other party</li>
	<li>Obama elected for promise of “change”</li>
	<li>Seen by followers as a “savior”</li>
	<li>But a U.S. President does not have the power to save everything</li>
</ul>
The remaining lectures will deal with an overview of American history, major trends, problems, analysis and interpretations, and an assessment of the first 2 ½ years of the Obama Presidency. However, at the time I am posting this study guide, I have not fully prepared the PowerPoints for those lectures/discussions. I may or may not add them to the study guide, but they will not be used on the final examination. All questions for the final will be based on what is already posted here.]]></content:encoded>

I first photographed it in spring, 2011, and returned to finish the job in October. Many bronzes and sancai photos are duplicated. I left the original photo, followed by the more recent one. But I added hundreds of additional photos as well. I also have 5 separate albums for the Shaanxi Provincial Museum, which has many similar artifacts. Photos by Gary L.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This is a special exhibit of a hoard of Tang Dynasty treasures displayed at the Shaanxi Provincial Museum in March, 2011. I have 5 earlier albums from this museum. Some of these artifacts can be found in my Tang Gallery album from 2009, and may even be better photos because the harsh lighting in this exhibit made it difficult to get good images.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The National Museum in Beijing opened in March, 2011, after 5 years of renovation. I have 4 albums of photos taken April 7, but the majority of the exhibits were not yet open. This one is a permanent exhibit about China's recovery following a century of degradation at the hands of the West. Much of the exhibit is photographs &amp; documents, and I omitted much. The English text I posted is highly informative - at many levels. Photos by Gary L.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Seven of the nine emperors of the Northern Song Dynasty (960-1127 AD) are buried in and around Gongyi, along with hundreds of royal family members and honored civil officials. Two Imperial tombs are currently protected and open to the public; the others lie scattered among farmers' fields. I have photographed six of the Imperial tombs, along with several lesser tombs. The statues are part of the "spirit way" leading to each tomb. Photos by Gary L.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Captain Lee Rorex and my dad flew in the 389<sup>th</sup> Fighter Squadron, 366<sup>th</sup> Fighter Group, of the 9<sup>th</sup> United States Army Air Force in Europe during World War II. Dad flew 75 combat missions, earned at least three Air Medals, and a Presidential Unit Citation for destroying 40 German locomotives during a 36-hour period. Capt. Lee flew with him on many of those missions. This is where I got my middle name – Lee – after Lee Rorex. In the 1980s he wrote a number of essays about his experiences during the war. He may have published them, so I suppose my putting them on my website without permission is piracy, but I thought the stories were too good to lie forgotten. Shortly after my dad passed away in 2000, Capt. Lee sent me these stories. My dad rarely talked about his war experiences, which is a common reaction among people who have seen real combat. So this was a welcome insight into my own father’s experiences. I dedicate this work to Maj. Dean Todd (ret.) and Capt. Lee Rorex, who flew these missions together. --- Gary Lee Todd<!--more-->

Civilian’s Memory Log: 4/20/84. Nightmare Mission. Bombed Factory Tonight! Again! 146 Heads, 284 Hands, 198 Legs, 264 Feet.

“AH-H-H! NO! NO! MY GOD! ISN’T FORTY YEARS ENOUGH!” I sat straight up in bed, screaming! My face was wringing wet; every muscle as tight as a spring. Around me floated heads and arms, legs, hands and feet! And, one of those heads was mine, grinning!

“Lee,” my wife called. She shook me. “Wake up! Are you all right?”

Noise, like explosions, all around. I’m floating up high; there’s smoke and swishing sounds. And, half awake, I cry; the sobs are wrenched away from deep down in my psyche, the storehouse of so much guilt and grief for forty years now! And the words stagger out, unbidden: “Dear God, isn’t forty years enough?”

Feb. 1945. Location Y-29, Belgium.

The German Air Force doesn’t give us as much trouble these days. It is short of planes, pilots, oil, everything.

And during these days, we get in close to the soldiers on the ground. We come in from above, and with machine guns blazing we rout out the Tiger Tanks; make them defend themselves; with 500 pound bombs blow them all to smithereens; destroy them so our ground forces can keep going. KILL THOSE GERMANS!

We also do interdiction missions. We cross over the Germans’ lines, go way back behind him, find a vital target in his supply link; like a bridge, railroad, highway or factory. Whatever, we blow it up! Powder it! This interrupts the Germans’ supply line; slows down his war; makes him afraid; makes him lose!

My days are spent now, blowing up trains; killing Germans. Or, strafing long columns of motor truck transport; killing Germans. Sometimes a bridge comes up for destruction, maybe holding a train, or trucks, and I blow it up; killing Germans. One tries not to think of the death and destruction; but when it’s right there in front of one’s eyes, well?

As with most Americans, I was taught from scratch to be respectful: of my elders, of others’ feelings and possessions. Later, when I could understand, came DO UNTO OTHERS, and THOU SHALL NOT KILL. I took them to heart. They became law. But, today, I violate the Godly rules! I kill, kill, kill! With abandon, I KILL! Punishment is sure to come.

Pilot’s Log Entry: 2/24/45 Dulken. Bombed Factory. Good Hits.

Today we have what we call a simple mission. Go out to the front lines, contact a ground forces radio, get directed to whatever target they want splattered, and go splatter it. Almost a ho hum, right?

I’m leading Slipshod Yellow Flight today. And, we’re out for blood and vengeance, as usual.

I take off, set an easy turn which allows my three wingmen to catch up and fall into formation. This done, we now scoot up behind Red Flight, and bingo, we’re off on another jaunt. We’re now a squadron mission, headed out on an official U.S. Army Air Corps assignment; conceived, approved and ordered by XXIXth TAC Headquarters; on our way, once again, to kill Germans.

The navigation is easy. I’ve flown this territory many times. Most of us know all the major checkpoints and rarely need emergency aid navigation. Just the same, all of us are alert. All too well, we know how quickly things can change in combat situations.

We spot our ground lines locations by the cerise panels the dogfaces lay out on the ground. We can see heavy gun emplacements, tanks, and soldiers. As long as we don’t hit them, they’re always glad to see us arrive.

We switch over on our radios and listen as Red Leader makes ground contact: “Hello, Sitting Duck, Slipshod Red Leader here, do you read? Over.”

“Yeah, Slipshod, this is Sitting Duck. Over.”

“Roger, Sitting Duck. What can we do for you today? Over.”

“Well, Slipshod, I’m sorry we can’t accommodate ya today. We had a bunch o’ Tigers in them woods east uv us this mornin’. But our big guns took ‘em out just a few minutes ago. We’re movin’ out, right now. Over.”

“Roger, Sitting Duck. Do I read you correctly, you don’t need us? Over.”

“That’s right, Slipshod. But please don’t go back to Tennessee, yet, there’s always tomorrow. Over.”

“Roger, Sitting Duck, we’ll be around. Catch you later. Slipshod out.”

Ho hum, not much of a war anymore. So, follow procedure. Call Big Crow. He’s up at some general’s HQ. He may have a target for us. We listen as Red Leader makes the second contact.

“Hello, Big Crow, Slipshod Red Leader here. Do you read? Over.”

“Roger, Slipshod. I was listening to you talk to Sitting Duck and would have called you. Over.”

“Real good, Big Crow. What can we do for you today? Over.”

“How are you armed today, Slipshod? Over.”

“Big Crow, we have 500 pound general demo and rockets. Over.”

“Good! Slipshod, Good! We have a target for you. Here are the coordinates: G-1, X-29. Crossroads, single building, looks like two big barns side-by-side. Positive ident will be a large white cross on top. We just learned it’s not a hospital. The Krauts are making rocket propellant in there. Go get it. And good luck. Over.”

“Roger, Big Crow. Confirm G-1, X-29. Over.”

“That’s affirmative, Slipshod. Over.”

“Roger, Big Crow. Slipshod out.”

A used-to-be hospital? Or not? Now a factory for making rocket propellant? Seems farfetched; but all’s fair in love and war. Besides, orders are orders. So, we go splatter it.

A few simple adjustments in our navigation and Old Slipshod is bound for G-1, X-29. Since all of us listened in as Red Leader made his contacts, all of us know the score. We need no briefing.

A few minutes now to think. Yesterday I blew up a supply column. Killed 50, or 75 Germans? My enemies. The day before I was free. No dead Germans that day. Day before that I helped blow up three or four Tiger Tanks. Maybe 12 or 15 Germans. My enemies, they tell me. And now, a factory. How many workers in a factory? A dozen? 100? 200? Or, what if it is a hospital? How many people in a hospital? 300? 400? Oh, but what the hell! They’re my enemies, too! Aren’t they? Besides, Big Crow said splatter it.

“Slipshod Yellow Leader, Red Leader here. Over.”

My heart skips a beat. I know all too well what his message is!

“Roger, Red, yellow here. Over.”

“Yellow, I see our building up ahead there. Red Flight will go up and give top cover. Take Yellow and blow that place off the map. Over.”

What could I say? But, “Roger, Red. Yellow out.”

And there it was; big as life. And to think those crummy Germans were using a white hospital cross to hide the manufacture of rocket propellant! Dirty Bastards! They’ll deserve everything they get!

I give a look at the rest of Yellow Flight, dip my left wing. The two planes on my right move under and over to the left and fall in on a left echelon. I look at the building which we’ve been circling. Sitting there like a little kid’s playhouse; waiting; vulnerable. Another couple of minutes before we’re in the right position.

I wonder if the Germans protect a hospital, or a rocket juice factory, the way they do an oil dump? With 5,000 guns! Or do they depend on us honorable Americans to honor their dishonest white cross?

In position now. I peel off and start down. A few bursts from the guns to encourage the Germans to keep their heads down. But no return fire. How many people in a factory? Or a hospital? Line up the crosshairs on that big roof. How many men? How many women? Thumb on the bomb release. How many children? Factory, or hospital? Now! Push the button! Bombs away! Pull up! Cram that throttle forward; give her all the power she’s got. Let’s go!

At that moment, I feel a concussion that seems to rock the earth, sky and especially tiny little P-47 Fighter-Bombers. I look back and down and, thank God, there are my three buddies coming up off the target. But, they fly like I’ve never seen any airplane fly; up, sideways, backward! The blast hurls us about.

Black smoke boils up and obscures much of the ground. I can actually see large objects floating in the air! How many people in a factory?

“Slipshod Yellow, Red here. I’ve seen a lot of explosions; but this one takes the cake! We saw every piece of that building come up! And now we see them falling! Over.”

“Roger, Red,” was all I could say. Pieces of the building? How about people? Them, too?

“Yellow, there had to have been a propellant factory there, to get an explosion like that! You didn’t hit any hospital today. Over.”

“Roger, Red. Let’s go home. Yellow out.”

“Roger. Red out.”

Yeah, go home. Good boys. We didn’t hit a hospital today; with doctors, nurses and patients. No, just a factory with workers, and supervisors, and bosses. People with all their heads, and hands, and feet, and arms and legs in the right places! My enemies, they tell me. What do you suppose my tally is, so far? 1,000 Germans? 3,000 Germans? Yeah, my enemies.

And one of them, in there somewhere, with my face.

**********          **********          **********

“Lee, are you all right?” my wife calls again.
<div>

Through the tears, and the hurt and the grief, comes my faltering reply, “I don’t know. I just --- just don’t see --- why I have to keep on paying, AND PAYING, ALL THE REST OF MY LIFE! DEAR GOD! ISN’T FORTY YEARS ENOUGH?!”

**********          **********          **********

</div>
HEAVEN/EARTH Log Entry: 8/21/45 Separation Mission. You go that way. You two go this way. You go that ---

Am I the lucky one? As I killed Germans, so they tried to kill me, and my comrades. Fate sealed the bargain, spared me, but not others. So, who was lucky?

There were Angove and Morris: both shot down, rescued by U.S. Troops. Were they the lucky ones?

And, Stinson: laughing, singing, happy man. He landed with a 500 pound fragmentation bomb hung up on his wing. It fell off, exploded and demolished his plane from the pilot’s seat on back. Stinson ended up that landing hanging on to a 2,000 Horse Power Engine dragging his butt down a steel mat runway. His shakes were so bad he couldn’t speak for days. They sent him away from us. Was he the lucky one?

And Purdy: tough, but nice guy. He quoted asinine poetry; funny. On a mission, a hit opened a leak in his gas tank. In one minute his cockpit was three inches deep in 100 octane, high explosive fuel! He bailed out! And walked back. Was he the lucky one?

And Conserva: gentle, a smile as big as all outdoors, adventuresome. Returning from a mission he cracked up on the landing end of the runway; cracked up his head and face, too. Permanently! Was he the lucky one?

And Gaithey, Meyer, Tanzell: victims of the clouds while flying the soup; crashed and found dead by our ground troops. Were they the lucky ones?

And Struth, McCauley, Pease, Peterson: shot down in dogfights and killed; Struth and McCauley on their first missions. Were they the lucky ones?

And Taylor, Gross, Barkley, Early, Pitts: shot down by ground fire and killed. Were they the lucky ones?

And Boehm, a trumpet player: crashed and killed in a bad weather landing. And Grounds, who had completed his tour of duty but refused rotation home. Hit by ground fire on a straight in bomb run. I was right behind him, and watched him die! Were they the lucky ones?

And Steinfelt: one of my roommates. Short, slight of build, just my size. He owned a military short coat. I kidded him, “When you move up as Group Commander, will you leave me that coat?” And we’d laugh. One day Steinfelt failed to return; shot down by ground fire. Sad, I went back to our bunk room. There on Steinfelt’s bed lay his military short coat, normally always on its peg, nice and neat. Did he lay it out for me? Was he the lucky one?

Some stayed at home and fought the economic battles with pliers and wrenches instead of guns. Were they the lucky ones?

Some paid the supreme price immediately, quick and with finality. Some suffered their obvious disabilities in front of all of you for the rest of their lives. Some see their own grinning heads amongst the nightmarish dreams of human slaughter. Some stayed at home and suffered the onslaught of these losses, mostly in silence. All made up a team; shared spirit and soul; received from each other; gave to each other, lived and died for each other.

So, who were the lucky ones? You tell me.

**********          **********         **********

Just ordinary guys doing a job. But then, all jobs this big are done by ordinary guys. And each one, like the pilot, expending that Universal Spiritual Soul in which all of us share. Martin Buber called it THEOPHANY - the meeting between man and God.

[FYI: KIAs mentioned are Joseph C. Meyer, Richard Tansell, Henry J. Struth, William McCauley, Stephen Pease, Elmer R. Peterson, James I. Taylor, Edward H. Gross, Rufus Barkley, Joe C. Early, Robert F. Boen, William Grounds, Bernard J. Steinfield, and POW Garfield Angove. I was not able to locate Gaithey (sp?) and Pitts on the casualty roster of the 366<sup>th</sup> Fighter Group, which maintains an excellent website.]

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Captain Lee Rorex and my dad flew in the 389<sup>th</sup> Fighter Squadron, 366<sup>th</sup> Fighter Group, of the 9<sup>th</sup> United States Army Air Force in Europe during World War II. This is their stories. See intro to previous post for more. I dedicate this work to Maj. Dean Todd (ret.) and Capt. Lee Rorex, who were ordinary men who did a great job and are true heroes, though they would never call themselves that. --- Gary Lee Todd<!--more-->

Imagine being twenty-one, a brand new 2<sup>nd</sup> Lieutenant searching for fighter pilot glory, and getting this announcement: “Lieutenant, you’ve been assigned to a P-47 Training Unit.” P-47! The Thunderbolt! 2,000 horse power radial engine, big as the side of a barn, slow as a truck! What happened to that sleek, pointed-nose P-51? Or that fighter pilot’s glorious dream the double pointed-nose P-38? F-O-U-L!!

“Men, welcome to the P-47 Training Unit. I’d ask how many of you volunteered for this Unit, except that all of us here are well aware that every one of you probably wanted to fly the P-51, right?”

Yeah, right! But, that’s the army for you! And, THIS IS the U.S. Army Air Corps, Feb. 1944. They say it, I do it! Me and this 12,000 pound aluminum wasp are stuck with each other!

So, here I sit in this bucket of bolts at the end of the runway. Ease the throttle forward, lock the tail wheel, now give her the gun. Whee-e-e doggie! The power pins me to the seat! In the air, Hey! It handles like a baby! Dive it; get maneuvering speed and pull it up into a loop. Man alive! It handles beautifully! And that power! Who wants to fly a P-51? Quickest first flight conversion ever performed!

And, it will carry more weight, deliver more fire power, take more punishment and still fly, than any airplane ever built! Yeah, and back home, I’ll bet you could plow with it!

“Well, boys, welcome to France and ground-support combat.” Listen now! This is me; the same guy with his nose stuck up in the air; only, eight months, twenty-three combat missions and a lot of smarts later. “Are you still sulking because you aren’t a P-51 glory boy?”

“Oh, sometimes I guess. But, Lee, will we NEVER get a chance at air-to-air combat? Will it always be just air-to-ground support?”

“Well, I’ll level with you; I flew my twenty-third mission yesterday and met enemy aircraft for the first time.”

“Oh, no!” “Hell!” “I was afraid of that!” (Lousy replacements! They never get here with an appreciation of the P-47 and close ground support!)

“Well, I sympathize with you, boys. But then, there’s Capt. Koff. He’s been over here a year and a half; he has 124 missions and 320 hours of combat time and has encountered enemy aircraft only once.” (Now listen to ‘em yell.)

“Oh, hell!”  “What a way to go!”

Now it’s time to get them indoctrinated. “Let me tell you what it’s like over here. Every mission takes us to, and across, the Rhine River now. And, on every mission we take ground fire like you wouldn’t believe. And, we do get hit once in a while.”

“Yeah, with what?”

“Well, I could answer that; but, here’s somebody who can do a better job. This is Lt. Gordon who owes his life to the endurance of the P-47. Listen to his story.”

“Hi, fellows. It’s true, what Lee says. There were eight of us up around Dusseldorf, doing a bombing and strafing job on a railroad marshalling yard. Those transportation centers are guarded like they were oil wells. Every caliber gun you can name is in use when you go down on them. From a hand held Luger to a 180 Howitzer, they are shooting at you! Well, I took a hit in the left wing, just outside the wing root. It exploded what ammunition was left, and when the smoke cleared away I saw a hole three feet wide and running from the front wing spar to within four inches of the trailing edge. I’m telling you, any three of us could have stood inside that hole.” Gordon stopped and let this sink in.

Somebody said, “Geez!”

Gordon continued, “Well, my first impulse was to jump. But then, I saw I was still flying, and the wing was still on there. So, I brought her home.”

A new man gasped in amazement. “And landed? With a wing like that?” he asked.

“Yep,” Gordon replied, “and walked away and that wing was still on there. My life was spared because this old Thunderbolt could take it.”

Looks of wonder adorned those new faces and, while they were engaged in being dumbstruck, I called up another man to incite some more admiration.

“Boys, this is Lt. Crusan. He flew back from a mission with one cylinder shot completely away. Tell us about it, Charlie.”

The new men were really dumbstruck as Crusan began.

“It’s true; the cylinder at the one o’clock position was gone. The piston and push rod were gone, along with all the oil! It was all over the windshield! I hung my head out the side and landed that machine, taxied into the revetment and shut off the engine just like normal. Nobody watching could believe it. Well, as soon as that power was turned off, the old engine gave a loud groan and simply stopped. With all the oil gone, all the metal was so hot that every piece of that engine simply welded itself to whatever it was touching! The whole engine was a solid mass of fused metals. But you know, that didn’t happen until that old P-47 brought me home safely.”

Wish you could have seen the astounded looks on those faces.

And, with that kind of built-in reliability, we blow Hitler’s trucks, trains, guns, supplies and soldiers all to hell! We follow the American dogfaced soldiers as they mop up the Ruhr Valley, Germany’s most heavily industrialized area. We clear the way from the air so the ground soldier doesn’t get hung up. If there is such a thing as glory in an air war, this is certainly not it!

We seldom get into an air-to-air dogfight - the kind that produces ACES and instant HOMEFRONT BOND SALESMEN. We always leave home loaded with bombs, rockets, and enough fifty caliber shells to decorate Washington, D.C. at Christmastime. We fight dogfights when we get jumped by the Jerries, or when flying escort for our big, four-engine brothers. Although trained for aerial combat, we are not efficient at the task nor apt to get that way. The following accounts, then, must, of necessity, be accepted for exactly what they are - stories of dive bomber pilots fighting for their own lives under the stress of air-to-air combat - “when it was nose to nose, him or me, live or die.” If you can discount the fact that in many of these cases pilots die, friends are lost, we extract the humor where it is to be found.

Today my friend Russell took his first step toward becoming an Ace. He shot down an enemy plane in mortal combat. Four more and he’ll join the magic circle.

Russ was flying Trombetta’s wing on a regular dive bombing mission. From out of nowhere the Germans swarmed in. The P-47 boys jumped into the fray. Trombetta, the leader, went after an ME-109. Russell, his wingman and tail protector, hung back. The 109, followed by two P-47s, racked into a tight left turn, drawing all three into a left circle. Suddenly, coming in from the right, another ME-109 slid into the circle between Trombetta and Russell. Why he chose to latch onto the front man instead of the last man no one knows. But, his choice sealed his doom! Russell opened up with his eight fifty caliber machine guns and blew the errant German Airman out of the sky. Russ called it, “fortuitous ace-making.”

And sometimes there is just no humor to be extracted. McCauley, from Florida, has been in the outfit for maybe a week. He tends to be quiet and, with his hands in his pockets, he listens a lot. Since he had only his training time behind him, he’ll have maybe two-hundred and fifty hours total flying time. Perhaps I’ve seen this man a half dozen times. His personality appeals to me and, I think I may have found a new friend. But, find in vain! Today, Mac flew his first combat mission in the European Theater of Operations, was shot down by a German flyer, and died. Tonight I’m looking for another new friend! That’s the way it is.

And Struth. He came in about the same time as Mac, but he was different. He had remained in the States as an instructor pilot after getting his wings. His total hours may run up as high as three or four thousand, with about fifty in the P-47. Today, Struth flew his first combat mission in the European Theater of Operations, was shot down by a German flier, and died. I never had a chance to learn his first name!

And then, sometimes, there is just the opposite: instant hero.

This one’s name is Driesler; Dries for short. Fresh in the outfit from Kentucky, with a crooked Dick Tracy nose, and a smile as big as his home state. On this day Dries flew his first combat mission and shot down a Focke-Wulf 190. He knocked the German off his leader’s tail, just as Russell did a few days before.

So, we tease Dries, accusing him of taking the easiest way into making friends in the outfit. For sure, he has one lifetime friend - his leader on that mission.

Pilot Log Entry: 3/2/45 South of Bahn. Strafed motor transport. Met ME-262.

We are on a regular bombing mission today. We’re loaded down and struggling out to the target at 150 miles an hour. Someone calls in, “Bogies, two o’clock high.”

We look and, sure enough, there they are: black, sleek and fast, with that big Swastika flashing the danger signal. There are only two of them and, since we are a twelve ship squadron, we figure they’ll stay away. So, we watch as they circle.

“Hey, Slipshod Red Leader,” comes a call, “do you identify those Bogies? Over.”

“Negative.”

“Hey, Red, I believe they’re jets. Over.”

“Jets?”

“Yeah, the brand new ones, the ME-262. Over.”

“Red Leader, Blue Leader here. He’s right. That’s the 262, alright. Over.”

In our powerful P-47s we are King of Air-To-Ground. But, facing aerial combat with the new German jet? Well, that’s an equine of a different hue! Of course, we’ve only heard the stories: 600, 700 miles an hour; more maneuverable than a P-51; and nobody, but nobody, could ever hit one in flight! As we look, we know fear.

Sure enough, the two sharks high above dip and start a run on us. They are going to take on all twelve of us at the same time. With twelve ships to shoot at, how can they miss?

Our Red Leader today is Kelly. Long and lanky, an easy smile, and with an air of confidence.

As the Germans turn in and down, Kelly’s confident voice comes over our radios: “Slipshod, Red Leader here. Now, listen up! Do exactly what I do, nothing else! Don’t jettison any bombs or rockets. We’ll beat this one.” Smooth and confident. He obviously has a plan, and, you can bet every one of us is ready to follow it.

The Germans, taking advantage of altitude and speed, are dropping in on our tails. Different pilots keep reporting their exact position as the angle changes. When Peterson calls in, “Bogies high, six o’clock, dead on,” (directly on our tails), comes the still confident voice of our leader: “O.K., Slipshod, do a tight turn left, NOW!”

And, we do. We stand those air-ground tanks up on their wingtips, pull back on the stick and advance the throttle. Those heavy old Thunderbolts respond with a slowdown and a very small diameter turn. Immediately, every pilot grins, or laughs out loud. The German Jets, positively rocketing in at 600 or 700 miles an hour, can never hope to turn inside of us; and this they must do in order to hit us in the air. It’s called curve of pursuit. With guns throwing bullets ‘way off into space, the Jets slide right on past us like someone grasping for the brass ring in a merry-go-round. Totally ineffective.

We watch as they pull up, and up, and finally just perch up there, looking. At which point comes Kelly’s voice over the radio again: “Slipshod, Red Leader here, you got the picture. These boys can’t stay here more than three or four minutes; they don’t carry enough fuel.” Ah, ha! A leader who has done his homework!

And, here they come again! Same speed, same direction. They can’t be very experienced. We watch, turn, avoid and laugh as the highly touted, newly developed German Jets slide away and disappear. And, twelve pilots of the heavy, waddling old P-47, the overweight aluminum wasp, breathe a thankful prayer, realizing we are alive to be a little smarter.

Our twelve planes, rockets and bombs still ready, guns still heavy with unwasted ammo, go our lumbering way and blow up two truck convoys, along with multiple tons of supplies and equipment, and send along a few hundred Germans to their everlasting, freedom-destroying rewards. The highly advanced technology of their air wing did them no good this day.

And, I’ve racked up another forty or fifty German-type humans, dead under my guns.

**********          **********          **********

Jan. 1, 1945, a memorable day for everyone, more memorable for some. This day the German Air Force makes a glorious, all-out effort and hits Allied Lines north and south, clear across Belgium and Germany. Allied estimates put the figure at 10,000 planes launched by the Germans today, most probably flown by teen-age boys for lack of properly trained pilots. One can only guess that their intent is to scare us out of the war.

But, cunning is the German mind. Last night, New Year’s Eve, he kept all of his pilots cold sober. Meanwhile, at least every other Allied pilot, mechanic, dog-face, paddlefoot and cook was smashed to the gills!! Came daylight, this A.M., a slight inequity in manpower stability existed.

My group is based on Location Y-29 near Watershei, Belgium. Muddleheaded and still celebrating, a bunch of us are sitting at breakfast swilling large amounts of black coffee. From far off, it seems, we hear what could be the bark of machine guns. But, we don’t really pay much attention.

Suddenly, someone bursts into the mess tent. “Hit the deck,” he yells, “we’re under air attack!”

Air attack? Impossible! That’s something we do to them. So, do us cocky and confident American pilots hit the deck? Hell no! We amble out for a look.

Outside, we look. There are a few planes around. But, man, that’s what an airfield is all about. P-51s, P-47s, a few Focke-Wulfs and Messerschmitts, and --- A FEW FOCKE WULF’S AND MESSERSCHMITTS!!

“HIT THE DECK! HERE THEY COME AGAIN!” and, sure enough, here they come! An FW-190 is flaggin’ it low right over our heads, machine guns chattering. With this added persuasion, us cocky and confident American pilots dive into holes, under tarps, trailers, or whatever! The bastards are actually strafing our field!

I raise my head and look up just as a P-47 is rolling for his takeoff. As his wheels break ground, about midpoint on the runway, the pilot opens up with his eight fifty caliber machine guns and blasts a low flying ME-109 right out of the air. My vision registers a pilot and plane, an explosion, bits and pieces. It will do things to you, friend.

“Here they come again!” comes the cry. We dive again, but can’t resist another look. Here comes another ME-109, low, fast and blazing away at anything and everything. The pilot is either dedicated or dumb! On his tail are two P-47s, blazing away at him, and kicking up the dirt all around us!

ZOOM-M-M, they go over. WHOOM-M-M, the 109 disintegrates, not over 100 feet off the ground!

“Anything else comin’ in?”

“Naw.”

We stand up. I see two P-51s latch onto a German plane in the air. In about fifteen seconds his goose is cooked. The leader shoots the German in a left turn; the wingman shoots him in a right turn; and POW! Gone.

Our Group manages to get up maybe a dozen P-47s. A P-51 Group, billeted across the field, gets up a few, no one knows how many. Together, they go up against an estimated 100 Germans intent upon wiping our field off the face of the earth. Result? No American losses. Germans? 22 planes shot down, with three possible but not verified.

For the next fifteen minutes, we on the ground are treated to the doggondest airshow ever staged as each victorious pilot roars in low and up with his victory roll.

In the midst of all the celebration a P-47 lands and the pilot jumps out of his plane, yelling at the top of his voice, “I got the bastard with my air-to-ground rockets!”

Sure enough, out of ammo and still up there with all the action, he’d seen a 190 crossing his path in front and out of range. So, in his own words, “I just pulled my nose in front of him, lifted it up until it blanked him out, and let go my rockets. I let the nose down just in time to see that son-of-a-bitch blow into a million pieces!” Air-to-ground rockets? No aerodynamic qualities, no control, designed to do only one thing and that’s FALL, STRAIGHT DOWN! And half the time miss! Well, heroes are born, not made.

**********          **********          **********

The Battle of the Bulge is in progress. Based at Liege, Belgium, we’re only minutes away. We sit here under a solid blanket of fog, unable to move.

Day after day we have waited. Some days we have even gone out to our planes, climbed in and just sat! Just so we could be ready if that fog lifted! But, no luck.

Today things broke up a bit, but only a bit. The overhead ceiling is three to four hundred feet. Above that is maybe six tenths cloud cover (meaning that the holes cover only four tenths of the sky). The weather is good only for desperation effort; and, in this weather we have gotten off two missions. I’ve drawn the third one and we’re ready to go.

PILOT LOG ENTRY: 12/27/44 Malmedy. Jumped by 190s and 109s. Got one twenty MM in left gun bay.

We are down around Bastogne, at about a thousand feet, dodging clouds and looking for Germans on the ground. This is a helluva way to go! All of a sudden, rat-a-tat-tat-tat! Machine gun fire, and I can hear it! Inside my heavy, loud, noisy P-47, I can hear it! And, I know why! In the air, a pilot can hear machine guns only if they are being shot from directly behind him. Old TAIL END CHARLIE has had it again!

A look back confirms the worst. A huge white and black propeller spinner is parked right on my tail, and, by deductive reasoning, I arrive at the conclusion that the rest of that FW-190 is right behind. The logic of my reasoning process is proved immediately. Bullets by the hundred start streaming past my cockpit and I can see the every fifth one which is a tracer, red and fiery. There is a pilot on that trigger and he is bent on my doom!

In addition to saving my life here, I have a duty to my fellow flyers; so, I push the mic button, scream, “BREAK, SLIPSHOD, BREAK!” like any good Tail End Charlie should, at the same time racking into a tight right turn, the German’s bullets flashing to my side.

Now, it’s just him or me, nose to nose, live or die. And, at the moment, he’s got the upper hand! I go up; he goes up. I sweat. I chop the throttle and skid left; he stays right behind, still shooting. I sweat! Having started at only a thousand feet, I am suddenly down to treetop level. I dive into a small valley and pray he has a thing about valleys. He obviously doesn’t; he’s still shooting and I’m still sweating.

Contour flying now, I pull up and over a small hill and down into another valley. My adversary is still blasting away but it is a fact that I have awareness enough to observe a jeep apparently stalled in the middle of a small river. There are four soldiers out in the water, perhaps trying to push it. As we scream overhead, I hope that the bullets miraculously missing me don’t hit them. I am still sweating, the German still shooting; by all rights, he should have had me by now.

I am forced to pull up for another hill, and do so reluctantly. The higher I get, the less he has to worry about the ground. But, where are the bullets? I look back and, thank God, there is the full belly silhouette of the German plane as he pulls up and does a turnaround. He is breaking off! He is quitting! In seconds we are far apart. The death threat is gone!

More an automaton than a person, I reach out to the throttle and slow that overheated and pounding engine. Reality creeps in on my consciousness; I’m not going to die! Not going to die! My breath is coming in labored gasps. My eyes blur and I actually black out for a brief instant.

Another reality creeps in. My stomach and thighs are wet, oppressively wet. Oh, no! Wounded and didn’t know it! Damn! I look down, expecting to see blood all over, but there is none. Just wet. But, in my fear, had I simply urinated all over myself? But then, awareness; there on my stomach hangs the loose end of my oxygen hose, dangling from my face mask. When not in use for oxygen, it simply dangles, serving no purpose, except to conduct all the sweat from my face and dump it in my lap! I burst out in a laugh, one third amusement, two thirds sheer mental and physical relief. More relaxed now, I wonder, for the first time, what kept my mother’s little boy alive this day.

Out of chaos, humor. In reliving this incident many times over the last forty years, a pertinent factor stands out in my mind. Sometime during this gut-wrenching ordeal, while death lurked only one explosive bullet away, I had felt the need to communicate my plight to my flight leader, miles away and probably engaged in a fight for his own life. At this juncture, I had pressed my mic button and yelled, “Slipshod Red Leader, this is Yellow four. I’m on the deck, headed west with an FW-190 on my tail!” My death scream.

From out of nowhere had come faithful Red Leader’s reply. “Stay with him, big boy!”

**********          **********          **********

Just an ordinary guy doing a job. But then, all jobs that big are done by ordinary guys. And each one, like the pilot, expending the Universal Spiritual Soul which all of us share. Martin Buber called it THEOPHANY – the meeting between man and God.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Captain Lee Rorex and my dad flew in the 389<sup>th</sup> Fighter Squadron, 366<sup>th</sup> Fighter Group, of the 9<sup>th</sup> United States Army Air Force in Europe during World War II. This is their stories. See intro to first post for more. I dedicate this work to Maj. Dean Todd (ret.) and Capt. Lee Rorex, who were ordinary guys who did a great job and are true heroes, though they would never call themselves that. --- Gary Lee Todd<!--more-->

In 1985, an airliner flying through heavy cloud cover is a thing of extremely sophisticated technological accomplishment. There is the radar to set the path and provide for any changes en route; and then the computer, fully programmed before the flight to handle take-off, all flying en route and landing at the destination, all without the pilot’s assistance. We have actually heard of cases where an airline pilot quit simply because the job became too boring for him.

In 1944 and ’45, while flying with the Ninth Air Force in Europe, the pilot who lived this episode learned a different story about instrument flying. His P-47 Fighter/Bomber was a one-man operation. He flew alone, but worked in groups of four to sixteen planes. They never asked for that cloud flying, but occasionally they couldn’t avoid it. And so, they flew the soup.

**********          **********          **********

Location Y-29, Belgium

“By God, Gather [Gaithey in the first essay], what I ought to do is bust you down to private and send you packing! I’ve been flying combat for a year and a half, and this is the first time I’ve ever had a wingman leave me in the soup! And, by God, IT HAD BETTER BE THE LAST!” To say the very least, the Colonel was mad.

Twelve fighter/bomber pilots had just returned from a mission over Germany. The weather was bad all over and they had been forced to fly in much heavy cloud cover. Gather, with maybe twenty missions under his belt, was no neophyte and he had committed the unforgiveable sin; inside the soup, he had broken formation and left the wing of his leader, endangering his life and those of his comrades.

I could remember my instructors back in the States explaining the flying-the-soup technique. “This is done in flights of four ships. The leader is here (putting a mark on the board). On his left wing is the Number Two man, and on his right wing is the Number Three man. It makes your basic “V” shape. On the right wing of Number Three, we put another man, Number Four. Number One and Number Three are always experienced men. They are leaders. Number Two and Number Four are usually new men. They always have a leader to stick with in case of trouble.”

In this team, then, only Number One, the flight leader, actually flew by the instruments. Inside the clouds his eyes were glued to those instruments. Every continuing second, those instruments told him rate of climb, airspeed, rate of turn and compass heading. The pilot’s concentration was absolutely amazing. He could never waver, speculate or hesitate; every second he had to be right! All our lives depended on that. It was a grind and the responsibility awesome.

What of the other three team members? They simply tucked in close to the ship they could see and hung on for dear life. How close? So close that the wingtip of one plane was overlapping the wingtip of another. This could easily put a wingtip within four feet of a fuselage, another wingtip and another tail fin. And there the pilot flew. No matter his wishes, feelings, state of mind or desires! All this required consummate skill.

Talk about faith! And trust! When you slipped your wing in next to your leader’s, you put your life into his hands. And, you took his life into yours, because, if you screwed up out there you could ram him and kill him!

All of us were proficient enough for the job; the real threat came to us in the form of a physical/mental nemesis called VERTIGO.

“Gather,” said Capt. Theis, “the Colonel almost sacked you this afternoon. You know that?”

“Yeah,” was Gather’s only reply.

“Well, we’re gonna go over this again, and this time it had better take! Now, when you broke off up there today, did you have Vertigo?” The Captain’s voice was softer now.

“Yes,” Gather answered.

“Alright, you review it for me. What is Vertigo, and how does it affect you?”

“Well,” Gather began, “the affliction comes when the eye is robbed of all its signal points. When the ground is gone, the horizon doesn’t exist, there are no reference points like trees, or buildings, or any object to cue the eye as to what is straight, or what is level, right, left, up or down.” He was practically quoting the book.

“Right,” Theis added emphasis. “And when Vertigo hits, what’s the effect on the man?”

Gather responded with the same command of the subject: “He might have perfectly normal response mechanisms, but now they go haywire. In straight and level flight, he will swear he’s going up, or turning. His whole body takes up this feeling and tells him to make a correction, fast!”

“And if he does, he’s had it, right?” Theis prompts.

“Probably,” Gather replies defensively. “If he makes a correction on his own, he breaks formation. This could cause a collision and kill people. Or he might fly into the ground and kill himself.”

“Right.” Theis’ voice fairly stabs the air. “Today, you were lucky. Just damned lucky! When you broke off, you managed to get oriented to your instruments in a hurry. If you hadn’t, you would have continued to fly your Vertigo and you would have crashed for sure!”

“But I didn’t!” a defensive Gather answers.

“No, you didn’t,” Theis replies, “this time!” He was solemn. In dead earnest, he continued, “Gather, I’m laying it on the line for you, don’t let there be a next time! You’re a good pilot! The others respect you for that. But this!” Theis broke off, shaking his head. “Gather, right now your fellow pilots are asking themselves a question, ‘What if Gather flies my wing tomorrow? Will he foul up again? Will he take me with him?’ You know this as well as I do, don’t you?”

“Yeah, sure,” a despondent Gather replies, “and they’re right!”

“You bet they are! We are a team, man. Each one of us depends on the other. Now, I want you to go to your sack. Sit down there and put your mind on this incident. Think it through step by step. This time, in your mind do everything right. See yourself hanging in there; feel yourself returning to normal and beating that Vertigo; feel your normal responses returning. Now, DO THIS, DAMMIT! It works!”

Gather was no coward; nor was he any kind of exception. Vertigo produced large panic for all pilots. Of course, the ability to control panic was a character trait, for sure. But, was the inability to control this kind of panic a character flaw? Had Gather been a mud-faced Marine, this supposed flaw might never have been discovered. Perhaps, too, any pilot, new or old, might not have controlled the panic at a given moment.

I’m sure Gather did exactly as he was told. And, he knew all the reasons. YOUR LEADER IS ALWAYS RIGHT! STAY WITH YOUR LEADER! THE INSTRUMENTS ARE ALWAYS RIGHT!

And so the dictum: STAY WITH YOUR LEADER. You may not like him personally; you may not respect him for personal reasons; but, trust him you will! STAY WITH YOUR LEADER! If you don’t, wartime combat has a grisly way of pointing up your mistakes.

Pilot Log Entry: Duren (Germany) Had to turn back. Bad weather. Landed with 200 foot ceiling.

The briefing this morning was a total tongue-in-cheek affair. “Boys,” this was our Colonel, “we’ll have to fly some soup today. The clouds are low here, but Stormy (all weathermen are called Stormy) assures me it will raise as we go east.” (Yeah, raise! 1,000 feet? 100 feet? 10 feet? How much?) “Our target is in this area and ---,” most of us lost him about here. All of us had gotten a look at those clouds out there. They were so low the birds were walking; you think they’re gonna raise? Fat chance! On the way out to the planes we gauge those clouds; maybe two hundred feet at the base. We’ll be in the soup by the time we form up.

No one is at my plane today but Sgt. Riorden, the Crew Chief. “Good morning, Lieutenant. You guys really gonna fly in this stuff?” Man, what a war! Even a ground man knows better! But, an old axiom holds sway: Your heart may belong to God, but your ass belongs to the U.S. Army! We fly!

Today we have three flights, Red, Yellow and Blue. We take off in that order. I’m flying in the second flight, so I’m Yellow Three. My leader is Capt. Koff, a seventy-eight mission man. Thank God! My wingman, Yellow Four, is Wright, a seven mission man. As we taxi out for takeoff, I’m playing the old combat game of worship-your-leader with Koff. He holds my life in his hands. It occurs to me to wonder what Wright is thinking of me. We don’t know each other that well. And his life is in my hands; he knows it and I know he knows it.

After takeoff, as Yellow is scrambling to get up into formation, I just happen to be looking at the right place to spot Red Flight. All four planes tucked in so close they look like they are tied together! And, in the span of my fleeting glance, all four simply disappear into the soup. As simple as that.

Now, Yellow Flight has formed up. I’m tucked in on Koff’s wing, close. When he looked at my plane I’m sure he thought I was a piece of flypaper, stuck on! Once Yellow Four is on my wing, I forget him. He’s on his own, to stay or not. Yellow Two is tucked in; that’s the team. And we disappear into the soup.

Inside, it’s a semi-white, dirty-water world. My eyes are riveted on Koff’s ship, just where the canopy joins the fuselage. Beyond his ship I can see Yellow Two, plainly; and, beyond him that dishwater sky, a sea of complete and utter nothingness. I mentally reassure myself that my leader is the best. I see a picture in my mind of these four ships going up in beautiful formation, see the angle to the earth, see the steady climb. This is my way of establishing a reference in this nothing world so the old nemesis Vertigo won’t get to me too badly when it hits. Because, hit it will! I’ve got thirty-four missions, but I never fly the soup without my old friend Vertigo horning in.

Blue Flight is the last to take off and form up. All of us hear the radio transmission: “Blue Four, come in closer. You can’t fly the soup ‘way out there!” Blue Four is Gather, being too cautious. And my heart goes out to Gather (without taking my eyes off my leader!). Back in the States all Gather wanted to do was fly; now he’s saying to himself, “Why the hell didn’t I join the Marines!”

As Blue Flight enters the soup, a thing is happening in Gather’s mind. He is rehearsing all those aphorisms: YOUR LEADER IS ALWAYS RIGHT; THE INSTRUMENTS ARE ALWAYS RIGHT; STAY WITH YOUR LEADER! Each sentence comes on a little louder. He knows he’s building to breakpoint. His old friend Vertigo will poke his head in any time now. Any time!

Without taking his eyes off his leader, Gather searches the perimeter of his vision for some blue sky that will tell him they are through this cloudy nightmare. But no, not so. As he stares at the side of his leader’s ship, suddenly it seems to roll over to the right and pull up as if going for a loop. His entire body convulses into a bundle of straining, groaning nerves, his stomach starts a nauseating slow roll and a pinching pain grabs his spinal cord. He can actually feel himself hanging upside down at the top of that loop! My God! These guys are crazy! His mind says. They’re going up much too fast! HOLD! EASY LAD! VERTIGO! STAY FAST! DON’T TAKE YOUR EYES OFF YOUR LEADER!

It’s possible that at the same exact moment, some or all of us were suffering the same torment; but, for Gather it was a brush with the Grim Reaper. And, if Gather had to reach out and grab a hand, that was the only one available.

“Yellow Leader, Red Leader here. We’re out in the clear at 8,200 feet. Red out.” There’s no reply from Yellow Leader, nor does anyone expect it. Yellow Leader is too busy, too concentrated to reply.

To a man, every pilot in every one of those thundering planes still inside the soup, fights back a pressing desire to grab a look at his altimeter. 8,200 feet. Wonder how high we are now? How much longer? Man, can I hold on, or not? DON’T TAKE YOUR EYES OFF YOUR LEADER!

“Blue Leader, Yellow here. We’re out at exactly 8,200 feet. Yellow out.”

Blue Four doesn’t hear this last transmission his mind is too occupied with thoughts of its own. My God! Here we go again! Pull out! We’re gonna crash! Sweat runs freely into his face mask. I’m gonna break off! I’ve got to break off!

“Red Leader, Blue here. We’re out. Over.”

“Roger, Blue. Red out.”

Out? We’re out? The laughing tears spatter down the face of Blue Four. No one could ever describe the relief!

“Slipshod Red Leader to squadron, these clouds seem to stretch as far as the eye can see. There’s not much use going any farther.”

So much for all those assurances of raising weather! And Blue Four? All this for nothing? Just practice?

“Slipshod Blue Leader, Red here. What do you see from ‘way up there? Anything different? Over.”

“Negative, Red. Clouds as far as I can see. And they get thicker up ahead there. Over.”

“Roger Blue. Well, Slipshod, we turn her around and go home. Red Leader out.”

Go home; welcome thought. Blue Four thinks so, too. But his second thought hits him like the explosion of a 500 pound general demolition bomb! “Oh, No! Not back into that soup again! NO, NO! I CAN’T DO IT!”

“Blue Four, come in a little closer. A LITTLE CLOSER!”

And there goes Red Flight back into the soup. And Yellow, and Blue.

At the end of what seems like an hour, but probably more like fifteen minutes: “Yellow Leader, Red here. We’re out at about 500 feet. Red out.”

And shortly: “Blue Leader, Yellow here. We’re out at 500 feet. Yellow out.”

And shortly: “Red Leader, Blue here. We’re out. Over.”

“Roger Blue. Red out.”

So there it is. The song has been played again. Everyone is clued in. each of us knows that everyone else is out and safe. Muscles begin to uncoil from the white-knuckle strain. Nervous eyes glance out to the side, furtively, as if committing a serious crime. DON’T TAKE YOUR EYES OFF YOUR LEADER! But it’s O.K. That’s clear air out there, if not sunshine. You can relax now.

“Blue Three, Blue Leader here. Over.”

“Roger, Blue Leader, what’s up? Over.”

“Uh, Blue Three, aren’t you supposed to have a wingman behind you? Over.”

In split-second consternation: “Hell, yes!”

“Well, Blue Three, he’s not there now.”

We were brothers, Blue Four and me. All of us were. And, I’m not talking rhetoric brothers, either! As my body breathed, so did all breathe; and for the same purpose, to sustain life, the common life. And, as Blue Four died, so did we all die, a little.

And the folks back home? Without knowing exactly why, or when, they all died a little, too. A part of that Universal Spiritual Soul broke away from each of them today.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This is the 4<sup>th</sup> of 6 autobiographical accounts by a P-47 pilot in the 366<sup>th</sup> Fighter Group of the 9<sup>th</sup> Army Air Force in Europe in 1944-45. Lee Rorex, the author, sent them to me in 2001 shortly after my dad passed away. He and my dad had flown together, and in many ways these essays tell the story my dad rarely talked about. I didn’t want the stories to be forgotten, so I decided to put them on my website and give them to the world. ---Gary Lee Todd (and this is where I got my middle name, Lee)<!--more-->

Pilot Log Entry: 2/2/45 Dedenborn (Germany). Time 1 hour 15 minutes. Had 50 mile winds. Bombed bridge and missed.

In the mission briefing that morning, the Colonel had been very specific about getting that bridge.

“Gentlemen, this bridge supports a double railroad and a paved highway. Now, the Germans are moving tons of frontline supplies across it every hour, every night. Those supplies have to be stopped! Allied lives and the success of the entire war effort in this sector depend on your success!”

The sky was cloudy; there was frost on the ground and the crisp air was cold. A mean wind whipped from the east and boded trouble from the start. A twelve ship squadron went out, unloaded twenty-four 500 pound bombs on that bridge and returned, never having hit that bridge once!

“There are no excuses, Colonel, “ Lt. Bates said in the debriefing, “but, one good reason; that damn wind, forty to fifty miles an hour, and ninety degrees cross the bomb run!”

Try hitting any target when your bomb platform is screaming down at 300 miles an hour; shoved to the left by an irresistible wind force; skidded back to the right by an overapplied foot rudder, fifty caliber guns blazing.

“And, man,” Blaker piped up in his tenor voice, “you should have seen the flak out there! And the smoke! Black as the front hinges of Hell!”

Yeah, flak. Unseen thousands of pieces of jagged metal, produced from shell explosions, seeking to tear the airplane and the pilot apart! Shot up from the ground, it’s called flak. Well, we just didn’t get the bridge, that’s all!

Pilot Log Entry: 2/8/45 Dedenborn. 1 hour 20 minutes. Bombed RR bridge and missed!!!

Yep, same bridge, same place, same results! Flak? The sky was black with the smoke. One flight came in high and unloaded; one tried it from down low. The third flight defied all the rules of safety and flew parallel to, and directly over the tracks! Right down the throats of those huge guns! Cut the rails on both ends of that bridge and never hit the bridge itself once!

Our debriefing that day was a brooding affair; our only consolation being that another squadron had given that same bridge a good old Yankee try that same morning without any better luck.

I was incredulous! How could I have been so close and miss? And twelve of us? The location had to be protected by one of those bomb-proof umbrellas we suspected the Germans had invented!

My sense of failure that day was a curious mixture of chagrin, disbelief and disgust, leavened by an hour and a half of gut-wrenching fear of death, ever present when in the company of a P-47 Fighter-Bomber engaged in the job of war! And the Colonel’s butt-slashing comments hadn’t added anything nice to the day.

Pilot Log Entry: 2/13/45 Dedenborn. 1 hour 15 minutes. Bombed RR bridge. Kaput. Barkley hit. Price bailed.

Yep, same bridge, same place. But, this time, results different! Kaput – that’s German for finished, wiped out, the end.

The poor Colonel, he wasn’t getting off scot-free, either. Some General up there was on his back. His Big Brass butt wasn’t in any better shape for sitting than was my Little Brass butt. So, he had a plan, brought into being by the General’s last and final admonition, I’m sure, to get that damn bridge, or “I’ll find someone who can!” – or something to that effect.

“Men,” said the Colonel at the briefing, “all of you are seasoned combat pilots. That’s why you’ve been picked for this mission.” A curious predictive feeling began a warm sort of glow down in the region of my tail bone. “Today, we’re going to GET THAT BRIDGE!”

How, today? All minds signaled. The Colonel answered the unvoiced question, “We’re going to skip bomb it!”

No, the Colonel wasn’t crazy! No, skip bombing wasn’t unheard of; just the most dangerous tactical bombing maneuver known to man! The Colonel continued, “I’m sure each of you will remember how the river comes toward the bridge from the east. Just a few hundred yards away, it curves to the south, passes under the bridge and wanders off to the southwest.” He was right, we remembered. I could close my eyes and see every detail of that terrain plain as day.

“Now then,” this was his way of saying FOR THE LAST TIME - the warm spot on my tailbone got hotter -“we’ll take two flights of four planes each. Red Flight will stay high as top cover. Yellow Flight (that was me) goes after the bridge.” Still hotter. “Yellow Flight, you men will let down to the ground about ten miles east. You’ll fly up the river just above the water. At this point, (stabbing the map), you’ll do a turn of about thirty-five degrees right. You’ll straighten out; in about one minute you’ll be over the bridge. As you approach it, you lift your nose, release your bombs, break right and up fast (yeah, fast) and get the hell out of there.” He was stealing my lines. But, there it was; sounded simple enough?

Well, consider: here are four airplanes as described earlier; I’m in one of them. Along with my three cohorts, I fly out into enemy territory; let that thundering ball of steel and explosives down to within ten feet of the ground. How’s that for a Sunday A.M. stroll? At that height you rise for fence posts, let down for potholes and hope that the frogs aren’t jumping today! It’s called CONTOUR FLYING.

Now, there’s a small complication. As I make my turn into the target, I’ve got sixty seconds to spot the bridge and release my bombs, right? But, the Colonel didn’t mention that other guy, the one in front of me whose bombs will be exploding under the bridge just as I come thundering in! And the pilot behind me? And behind him?

This is taken care of by spacing, right? If I’m spaced back far enough behind the guy in front of me, his bomb blast won’t hit me. Fine. But, suppose he makes a perfect hit on that bridge? Up in the air will be parts of everything! Bridge! Trucks! Concrete! Rocks! You name it! --- How high do they go? --- How long to get back down before I thunder in?

But, all the logic is on our side. By coming in so low to the ground, the Germans won’t be alerted. We’ll surprise them. Besides, we’ll be flying so low to the ground that they can’t depress those big guns low enough to hit us. Besides, our speed will be such that they won’t have time to fire at us anyway. Piece o’ cake! Besides, even the Germans wouldn’t believe that any American would be fool enough to try a stunt as dangerous as this! Besides, it’s Sunday.

For some curious reason, we always hurry out to the planes as though on the way to Coney Island instead of a death circus. I get a quick look at the weather and climb in. The roar of that huge engine tends to quell the small fingers of fear which have replaced the warm glow around my tailbone. Red Flight gets off first and Yellow Flight rolls out in order. I am number three man. That means that out of four planes, I’ll follow two into that bridge. The leader will follow no one; the number two man will follow one; the number four man will follow three. Do I ever calculate whose chances are what? Only about a hundred times!

Red Flight takes off and goes high. That’s where you go to look for enemy planes looking for you. Yellow Flight takes off and stays low. That’s where you go to search out a Sunday morning’s sport. It occurs to me that as soon as we are back, I must hurry over to the Chaplain’s tent for late services. Perhaps, with his connections, he can arrange a pardon for all of us who are out killing Germans this Sunday A.M.

Scared? No, that’s not the name for it. My mind is working too fast to absorb fear. Tense? Yes, but mainly in the stomach; good training has taught the arms, hands, legs and feet to perform without thought conscious directions. A little fear nibbles away at the back of the mind; fear of death perhaps, but not enough weight behind it to be distracting. Mostly, just absorbed; fly this beast right every minute; every moment look for those bogeys; they can jump you, shoot you down and be gone in less than a minute flat. Hope old Red Flight is on the ball today.

“Yellow Flight, this is Slipshod Red Leader. Time to hit the deck. We’ll be watching you all the time. We’ll keep the Jerries off your backs. Good luck.” The radio lapses into silence.

Who has anything to say?

Yellow Leader signals for a left echelon formation by a dip of his left wing. All of us take up a position on his left, stepped out and away. Here is that SPACING. All of us have the bridge in sight, again! We see Yellow Leader nose over and start down. We follow in order. The ground comes up fast. Part of the maneuver is to come down with close to full throttle to gain speed. At ten feet above the river we level out. Or is it eight? We push the throttle to the firewall and wish for more power. A minute and a half to go.

All thinking of a superfluous nature stops here. Concentration, that’s the name of the game. Flip on the gunsight and firing switches; flip on the bomb-ready switch; push the bomb ARM button. I am now a parcel of steel, oil, gas, death-spewing guns and totally destructive explosives, streaking along at three hundred miles an hour, ten feet off terra firma, a blur of indistinguishable objects. Only up ahead can I see. And, I see Yellow Leader lean his right wing over, ever so slightly, as he starts his bomb run. For him, sixty seconds now.

As Yellow Two turns in, I am aware of blast flames and black smoke up ahead. For Yellow Two, sixty seconds now.

With hardly a thought as to the bunch of trees that mark the turn point, I bend my right wing over and start my own bomb run. For Yellow Three, sixty seconds now. Flames, smoke and dirt fill the air in front of me.

The smoke is already a hundred feet in the air. My mind, wholly on the task of execution, nevertheless registers objects other than smoke in the air – solid objects, flying. THERE IS THE BRIDGE! Or, part of it. Nose up slightly. Press the bomb release button and then start fighting for my life. Bend that right wing over; pull back on the stick and go up, up, the sudden G Forces forcing my body down into the seat, my breath momentarily crushed to a standstill; rock the wings back and forth; skid right, left, right; that’s just in case some smart jasper on the ground has figured out how to shoot at me as I leave the target. Roll out left, look back and down. There comes Yellow Four up off the bridge. Hey, NO BRIDGE!

“Red Leader, Yellow Leader here. I’m hit bad! Gotta go quick! I’m bailing out!” SHOCK! I look ahead, but can’t spot my flight leader. Nerves screaming for relief, I force myself to pull back on the throttle and slow down that overworked engine. The flak is no longer bursting around me. I start a lazy circle to allow Yellow Four to catch up. Look! Look, damn you! Yellow Leader’s out there somewhere.

“Red Leader, Red Three here. Look to the south, just over those trees and you’ll see a parachute. Over.”

“Roger.”

All of us are looking! And, there he is! And, alive! Good old Price, from Indiana, they couldn’t kill him!

“Red Leader, Yellow Four here. I’m hit bad! Still flying, but my engine is running rough and I’m losing oil pressure. Over.”

SHOCK!

“Roger, Yellow Four (he’s right behind me), do you think you can get all the way back? Over.”

“That’s Roger, Red Leader. I’ll be show, but I believe I can make it.”

Those bogeys can still be up here. Yellow Four is now a sitting duck. Yellow Two and I drop back, one on each side of wounded Yellow Four. Old buddy Barkley is just a black helmet and a pair of dark goggles to my vision. But I experience the condition of his body and mind. My frustrated desire to lend help forces a near scream from my lips. After all, it has been only two minutes since I flew through that killing hell down there. But, aside from heart palpitation, gut strain, post bomb-run terror and the bogey threat, all of us make it back to the field and land safely.

“General,” the Colonel said into the phone, “we got that bridge. (Pause) Thank you, sir.” He hung up, and smiled as he looked at the rest of us.

Three days later, old buddy Price walked back into our ready room, the same big grin on his face. When he landed in his chute, he had shed it and started running. His senses were good because he ran smack into a camp of the French Infantry. They had watched the whole show as Slipshod knocked out the bridge, the one that had supplied the German ground forces opposing them for the last eleven days. The Frenchmen were so thankful for the help that they kept Price drunk for two days toasting the American Air Forces. And, all this as they moved up to rout the Germans.

What does it all mean to me, forty years later? Well, I don’t know, but for sure, that gutwrencher is still a permanent part of my psyche. And, the pictures are just as clear; the feelings just as real; the destruction just as numbing; and the death? Well, I was too late to make that late church at the end of that mission. Oh, God, where is thy forgiveness?

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[My dad was a writer, too. He was aviation and business editor of the Rockford Register Republic from 1954 until he retired in 1981. He edited and actually did much of the writing of Fish Hassell’s autobiography, <em>A Viking with Wings</em>. But so far as I know, he never wrote about his own experiences as a P-47 pilot with the 9<sup>th</sup> AAF. Lee Rorex did, 40 years after the war was over. He told me my dad – Dean Todd - was with him on most or all of the missions he wrote about. So this is my dad’s story as well as Capt. Lee’s. ---Gary Lee Todd<!--more-->

The location is Laon-Couvron, France. It is northeast of Paris. Funny, I have never seen the town, just the patched up runway. It has been filled and refilled while serving as a German air field. But, patched or not, we now have a runway for the first time in my seventeen missions. Heretofore, we’ve used a steel mat rolled out over the dirt for our takeoffs and landings.

We moved up closer to the front lines three weeks ago. Our daily flight missions take us up to and across the beautiful Rhine River. We’ll move up again soon in order to give close support to the dogface soldiers.

Of necessity, we fly low and slow. Low because we knock out ground targets; and slow because we’re always loaded to the gills with bombs and rockets and machine gun ammo. We work from a thousand feet, fly in all kinds of nasty weather and do our best to help those mud-sloggin’, bullet-dodgin’ G.I.s on the ground. Sometimes a different kind of thing comes along.

Pilot’s Log Entry:  11/9/44.  Rhine River. Dive bombed oil dump. 20-40-50-88 Flak. Most flak I ever saw.

All days are memorable, after they are over. From the time I got up at six this morning, this one has had memorable written all over it. The clouds, solid and a little black, are hanging low and ominous. I recognize this as a sign; not one learned from my old country grandpa and his trick knee, but one learned from the Colonel which he very carefully threw out at our mission briefing last night.

“Boys, we’ve got a chance at a big one tomorrow. An oil dump, right here,” stabbing the wall map with a finger. The thump of his finger hitting the wall caused some pilot-type muscles to jump reflexively. Any sound that comes suddenly and with a thump does that to us. We’re flak-happy from being shot at day after day; losing buddies; telling unfunny jokes to take up the slack in dead conversations.

“Boys, we’re being given this mission because there is no Heavy Bomber Group available right now. If we take out one of Hitler’s main oil supply stations we’ll shorten this war, and how!”

Yeah, and how! We’re ready for it to be shortened, like yesterday! And then came that omen, that sign marked memorable, remember?

“Boys,” he always calls us boys – Lt. Colonel Harvey W.C. Shelton, 7<sup>th</sup>, the old man – he’s twenty-four years old. “Boys, this one is so big, we’re taking a thirty-six ship group. We’ll go, no matter what. The weather doesn’t look good, but it’ll take a hurricane to keep us on the ground.”

As I look this morning, those clouds not only are NOT hurricanes, they have left a gap of maybe five hundred feet between them and the ground. Plenty of room for a fighter-bomber pilot! Right? Yeah, an ominous day.

The 390<sup>th</sup> Squadron fires up first. They are leading the group and the rest of us watch as they put twelve ships into the air. I can’t help a wry laugh as I watch twelve ships take off, and suddenly disappear into those ominous clouds.

The 391<sup>st</sup> Squadron goes next; fire up, take off, disappear. Funny how those ominous clouds can swallow up group after group and never even seem to get a full stomach. So, there they are, waiting.

So, here goes the fightin’ 389<sup>th</sup>, old Slipshod by radio code, anything but slipshod in its gory work. Fire up, take off, disappear into those ominous clouds. We pray it will be a short instrument climb.

On the radio: “Cougar Red Leader, Slipshod here. Are you out of the soup yet? Over.”

“Negative, Slipshod, and I’m at 9,000 feet. Cougar out.”

Nine thousand feet! We haven’t been this high in our last five missions all added together! Who we gonna bomb, anyway?

On the radio: “Slipshod, this is Red Leader. Better slip into some of that oxygen. We’re going through 10,000 feet.”

Ten thousand feet! Has the world gone mad? Not only ten thousand feet up, but we’re still in those ominous, kinda black clouds, remember?

“Cougar Leader to group. We’re out on top at 17,500 feet. Cougar out.” His voice holds a slight touch of disbelief, with just a snitch of humor. He knows what all of us are thinking. Why, man! We have started bombing and strafing runs from a thousand feet! Most of the time! And now, 17,500!

It always happens all of a sudden. Old Slipshod bursts out of those ominous, kinda black clouds. Just as in the movies, in the blink of an eye we are in a world of sparkly bright sunshine. Below are those now fairy-like clouds, bubbling, pushing up in beautiful, convoluted, rolling patterns; reflecting the sun back in priceless sparkles of gold, magenta, blue and white. It is a wonderland, the proportions and color of which Disney never could have matched. A description of my feelings at this point is impossible.

I check my altimeter. Sure enough, 17,500 feet above terra firma. And out there, all over it seems, are little black specks struggling along with two five hundred pound bombs under the wings, four air-to-ground rockets alongside, and a huge gasoline belly tank slung underneath to get home on. Thirty-six of us in all. Today I’m number thirty from the front.

“Cougar Leader, Slipshod Red Leader here. Who we gonna bomb from way up here, anyway. Over.”

“Cougar Leader here. I don’t know unless they come up here with us.” We hear him laugh.

“Cougar Leader, Indian Red Leader here. There at about two o’clock is a pretty good hole. It might help us. Over.”

“Roger, Indian. We’ll have a look at it. Cougar out.”

It is all sorta like a dream play. For old number thirty up here, way back from the front end of the line, I am immersed in a powerful drama consisting of romancing a responsive P-47 Fighter/Bomber up through 17,000 feet of solid clouds, zooming around startlingly beautiful cumulus formations, and, at age twenty-two, observing more natural beauty than most people are permitted to see in a life time. To a romantic like this, war and life-threatening danger are a world away.

“Cougar Leader here, listen up.” We listen. “You’ll find this hard to believe, but it’s true. This damn hole is a couple of miles across, and it sits right on top of our oil dump! So help me God!” we can hear his amazement.

“Cougar, Slipshod here. What’s the plan? Over.”

“Well boys, just like we planned. Cougar will go in by flights; Indian will follow, and Slipshod last. Everything’s the same except that we’re starting a bomb run at 17,000 feet. Good luck. Cougar out.”

That didn’t sound so bad, did it? But, think of falling from 17,000 feet and those ground gunners have all that time to blast away at you! Normally we start from about a thousand, or so. Makes a difference. Yeah, ominous.

Old number thirty sitting up here with his rose-colored glasses on, hypnotized by the romantic beauty of it all, watches as Cougar Red Leader peels off and down, followed by his three chicks. Then Yellow Flight peels off and down, and old number thirty comes out of his romance trance. Coming up are black puffs, and more black puffs. Some red streaks appear, fade and reappear. It’s a little like the 4<sup>th</sup> of July, except that these fireworks are of a different nature and spell death, no matter what color!

Cougar Blue Flight peels off and down. I have trouble following them through the smoke. Indian Squadron starts their bomb runs and I can see multiple red flashes on the ground as Cougar’s bombs begin to burst. I see Indian Blue Flight go down and disappear into the smoke. Damn, it’s black down there! And the air is filled with millions of pieces of shattered iron, just waiting for a plane to run through.

By now, rising from the ground are a succession of smoke plumes. Black and angry and filled with burning oil, flak and all kinds of ground debris, they rise three thousand, five thousand feet into the air. Cougar and Indian are doing their jobs, and how!

I have now counted twenty-four of those seemingly tiny black bugs as they dropped off into the black hole in pursuit of death and destruction. Of a sudden, a thought hits me: all those Germans on the ground have to do is to take a gun, any gun, point it up into that hole and pull the trigger. No aiming necessary! How could you miss? And, how many Germans guard an important oil dump? 1,000? 5,000? Maybe. And every kind of gun from a Luger to a 105 howitzer! That’s one thing it means to be number thirty from the front!

I watch, now, as Slipshod Red Flight peels off and down. By now the sky is so black as to appear solid. I’d swear that a man could land his plane at 10,000 feet and just get out and walk away!

Number 25, 26, 27, and 28. Slipshod is on its way down.

Slipshod Yellow Leader peels off and down. Being right behind him, I have the best seat and, so help me, my leader momentarily disappears in the black smoke! So help me!

I am peeling off and down. The black envelops me, then breaks. I immediately see a horrible thing one doesn’t usually live to tell about. At ground level, I see a huge shell leave its gun barrel and traject an upward path. I am well aware that to see this I must be sitting precisely on its trajectory path. In other words, I’M DEAD! “Dear God, save me today,” is the prayer which parts my lips.

My plane is now screaming down at 350 miles an hour. Zig-zag so as not to be hit, you hope. Press off a few rounds so as to keep those German heads down. The shell hasn’t hit me; exploded below me, obviously. My eye lines up what looks like an oil tank grouping. Switch on, bombs armed. Living a life often charmed. Air black, filled with flack. 10,000, 5,000, altimeter spinning, death grinning. Noise, ringing, sweat, fear. Can’t hear. Press that bomb release! Pitch! Pull up,               SON-OF-A-BITCH! Don’t get hit now!

And then, amidst all that hell and indiscriminate death, a miracle of humor, perhaps the only way to stay alive in times like this!

It lasts only a few seconds, much less time than it takes to tell. Just as I release my bombs, I look to the right; why, I don’t know. There, in plain sight, is another P-47. An eighth of a mile over, it flies a path similar to mine. It pulls up, it zigs and zags. But, all this without the benefit of a fighter pilot. I’ll swear I can’t see him! Just the plane!

And then, as we come up, and up, and away from the indiscriminate death and destruction, it happens. I know who’s in that plane, old number thirty-one, Pinkerton. As I watch, spellbound, amidst all the black, and horror, and terror, and fear and death, a leather covered head appears above the bottom window sill, followed by a pair of goggles. They pause, look. I burst out into uncontrollable laughter and shout, “Peek-a-boo, Pinkerton.”

The man has found his own way of coping with death. I wish I had thought of it.

Thirty-six planes dived into that black hole filled with sudden, bloody death. Thirty-six planes pulled up, flew home and deposited thirty-six fighter-bomber pilots alive, happy and thankful. Why? How? Huh! You TELL ME!

The oil supply station? It simply ceased to exist. The German ground gunners? Them, too. I was told they were my enemies.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This is the 6<sup>th</sup> and last of the essays Lee Rorex sent me in early 2001. He and my dad flew together in the 289<sup>th</sup> Fighter Squadron, 266<sup>th</sup> Fighter Group, 9<sup>th</sup> U.S. Army Air Force, the tactical Air Force in the European Theater. I remember in a letter to me he once referred to himself as a “hired assassin.” This surprised me. Vietnam had made me decidedly cynical, but I had thought World War II was the “good war.” But my dad almost never talked about it, and Capt. Lee was still having nightmares 40 years later. I guess there really is no “good war.” ---Gary Lee Todd<!--more-->

In all outfits there are paragons – paragons of virtue, paragons of vice. In our outfit we had a paragon of intellect. His name was Bengie.

Bengie looked ordinary enough: five-foot seven, sandy hair, blue eyes and a shy smile. He walked and talked like the rest of us, but, there all resemblance ended. Inside Bengie’s head was a brain that soaked up information like a present-day computer. He could pursue two conversations at once, and his thought processes were so swift as to leave good minds boggling.

I’m quite sure that in his training time, Bengie had soaked up the airplane, all components, navigation, including the great sidereal system upon which all is predicated, maps, charts, graphs, manufacturer’s specifications, superiors and instructors. Where Bengie went a mental vacuum must surely have followed.

By the time of my arrival overseas, he had completed forty combat missions, was serving as squadron leader and was respected as a proven combat pilot. However, in combat Bengie was competent but no master, as is often the case with genius.

But, mental genius is a twenty-four hour-a-day thing. And, flying a plane did not keep Bengie’s mind fully occupied. Oh, if he were tangled up in a nose-to-nose dogfight, or doing a bombing/strafing run, he undoubtedly gave his full attention and mental faculties to the task. He was conscientious.

But, think of it; an hour and a half out to a target, fifteen minutes work, an hour back to base. Those long hauls could get to be a bore! So, Bengie took along something to relieve the boredom, whatever current-interest best seller was available in paperback.

Word got out. His fellow pilots didn’t like it! Their leader sitting up there reading lusty historical novels, while they just managed to fly right, search for bogeys, take time to be scared and sweat. What the hell kind of war was this?

So, they laid traps. Half way out to the target someone would push the mic button and ask, “Slipshod Red Leader, Blue Leader here, where are we, anyway?”, trying to sound nonchalant. Then all the rest of us would listen intently.

“Uh, Blue Leader,” would come the reply, “on your left is Dazzleburg, on your right is Stuttsmesson, and the point on the river up ahead is Dusseldorf. We’re at map coordinates X-2, G-21. Uh, sixteen minutes to target.” Bengie would then sink back into the glutz and glitz of his porny vice book, having been more specific than any one of us who was navigating full time. The rest of us would sink back into our defeated desire for justice, not the least bit willing to admit that we envied our precise leader ever so much.

But justice, if that is the proper word for it, would prevail, and the horny-headed beast doesn’t always cast the chips evenly, discretely or even fairly. Such was to be Bengie’s downfall.

Pilot’s Log Entry: 11/21/44 Dusseldorf. Encountered E/A for first time. Jumped thirty ME-109s. 30 for top cover. Russ got one. Squadron total 10-3-4.

Bengie led the squadron today. Twelve ships, we went out into Mr. Hitler’s gigantic production fields of coal and iron and blew away another thirty or forty of his hauling trucks, many tons of his precious supplies and no telling how many of his faithful workers. From the position of the Allies fighting this war, this was a hugely successful mission. Destruction, destruction, destruction!

So, here we were on our way home, Bengie with Red Flight in the lead, Yellow Flight behind and below, Blue Flight behind and higher. This was standard operating procedure, except for the lead position of Bengie’s porn book. It was leading us back from a very successful bombing mission, all excitement behind us.

But, fatefully, not so! Suddenly, with no warning whatsoever, both Yellow and Blue Flights were up to their butts in German ME-109s and FW-190s. No one saw them, they were just there! No one called them in on the radio. I guess when your psyche bluntly switches from serene to fight you forget little details like a radio call. There went Red Flight, none the wiser.

In about three minutes all was over. An estimated sixty Germans and eight Americans spewed thousands of rounds of death-dealing ammunition at each other. Scores of man-type human beings strained, and sweated, and feared death. Ten Germans tasted it because that’s how many were shot down. Three more were MAYBEs because we couldn’t confirm them as kills. Three minutes of hell.

And Red Flight pursued its happy way home, the porn book not having spotted the fracas behind. Yellow and Blue formed up, after a fashion, and came on in, too.

I don’t remember, exactly, all the reasons given for the late arrival home of Yellow and Blue, but for sure no one said anything near the truth as everyone came straggling in from the flight line. At the debriefing meeting, after Red Leader had given his account of a very successful bombing and strafing mission, Yellow and then Blue Leaders gave their accounts of one helluva dog-fight mission on which they shot down ten German planes and probably three more. No enmity, mind you, just all in a straightforward manner. But, I’ll leave it to your imagination what kind of meeting we had from there on out!

Bengie took it all in good grace. The Colonel surely chewed him out good and proper, but he was saved much ribbing and embarrassment by being furloughed home after completing fifty combat missions.

Since no one wished Bengie anything but good, and now admitted that he was simply envious, we now found that we missed him. Very few outfits are privileged to have a genius aboard. And, there was absolutely no chance, whatsoever, that we’d get another one as a replacement! No, for us, there could be only one Bengie; and we were the losers!

**********          **********          **********

Just an ordinary guy doing a job. But then, all jobs that big are done by ordinary guys. And each one, like the pilot, expending that Universal Spiritual Soul which all of us share. Martin Buber called it THEOPHANY – the meeting of man and God.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Longmen Grottoes consists of over 100,000 Buddhist images carved in caves during the Northern Dynasties, Sui Dynasty, &amp; Tang Dynasty, c. 500-900 AD. Highlight is the Grand Buddha Niche, of which the central figure represents Maitreya, the Buddha of the Future. It was commissioned by China's only female emperor, Wu Zetian, and supposedly is based on her physical features. I have an earlier Longmen album with 688 photos from several previous trips. This one was made in June, 2011, with a new Canon EOS600 digital camera. Photos by Gary L.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I first went to China in 1991 to teach teachers during the summer. But mostly I was a tourist taking in the sights, tastes, and sounds of a new and wonderful culture. My photos of the Great Wall, Summer Palace, Forbidden City, and of Chengdu sites have already been posted in the appropriate albums. This album is all the rest of my photos - the people and places where I visited and worked. These photos themselves are now history, since many of these quaint alleys have been replaced by modern shopping malls, and the ubiquitous bicycles by bumper-to-bumper automobiles. The China in these photos is pretty much gone, the victim of prosperity and progress. Photos by Gary L.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[These 2 rooms of jade &amp; bronze in the Freer Gallery of the Smithsonian in Washington, D.C., were not here in 2009. They have such a large collection that they rotate it. The photos I took then are posted in a separate album labelled Chinese &amp; Asian Art. It can be located on the website under July 2009. These artifacts were mostly acquired from China during the Warlord Era (c. 1920s), and the bronzes were cleaned. We don't do that today with ancient bronze, but it does give a better idea of what they looked like when they were new. Photos by Gary L.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This Western Han Imperial tomb is probably China's best-kept archaeological secret. It only opened to the public a few years ago, and there is not yet public transportation to the site. The terracotta warriors are a third the size of the more famous ones of nearby Qin Shihuang's tomb, but here visitors can walk over the pits and see the excavations in progress. More importantly, this tomb doesn't have the pressing crowds of the more famous neighbor. Like the Qin Shihuang tomb, the Han Yang tomb itself has not yet been opened. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of History, Sias International University, Xinzheng, Henan, China. <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/116512474184071531500/HanYangLingMausoleumOfHanEmperorJingdiXiAn">https://picasaweb.google.com/116512474184071531500/HanYangLingMausoleumOfHanEmperorJingdiXiAn</a>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The Hebei Provincial Museum was mostly closed for renovation in late 2011 and not scheduled to open until the end of 2012. They had but two temporary exhibits. The first was of some first class pieces from the ancient states of Yan and Zhao. The second was of relics collected in recent years at the site of the construction of the great canal which will bring water to Beijing from south of Henan. This huge construction project has uncovered thousands of ancient artifacts spanning thousands of years. Like the Provincial Museum, the City Museum was also closed in order to upgrade security.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Liu Wu was a member of the Han Dynasty royal family. He ruled over the state of Chu in the early Western Han, and built a tomb on Shizishan (Lion Hill) with a guardian army of 1/3-size terracotta warriors. I photographed the tomb, along with an underwater burial site of terracotta cavalry, and a larger pit of infantry. Compare this with the tomb of Han Emperor Jingdi, as well as the more famous life-size warriors of Qin Shihuang (both on this website). Photos by Gary L.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The first artifacts shown here were owned by Leonid Brezhnev and are currently in my possession. The photo album was presented to him by 18th Army veterans, for whom he served as political commissar during WWII. These are published here for the first time. The 63-piece ribbon bar includes his Order of Victory which he was awarded as General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. It was rescinded after he died in 1982, as he had obviously done nothing to earn it. Copies of the ribbon bar have appeared on eBay, but this one is genuine. Following the photo album are other Soviet artifacts in my personal collection, along with my Mao badges from the Cultural Revolution. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of History, Sias International University, Xinzheng, Henan, China. <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/116512474184071531500/LeonidBrezhnevPhotosAwardsOtherSovietMilitaria">https://picasaweb.google.com/116512474184071531500/LeonidBrezhnevPhotosAwardsOtherSovietMilitaria</a>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Xinxiang City, which lies between Zhengzhou and Anyang, just opened this excellent, modern museum at the end of 2011. I believe I'm the first foreigner to visit it. Xinxiang is the site of the ancient battle of Muye, in which the Shang Dynasty was destroyed by the Zhou, so this area is rich in Shang artifacts. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of History, Sias International University, Xinzheng, Henan, China. <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/116512474184071531500/XinxiangMuseum">https://picasaweb.google.com/116512474184071531500/XinxiangMuseum</a>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Duke Lu (Zhu Yuliu), 1568-1614, was the only full brother of the Ming Emperor Wanli. His tomb near Xinxiang is the only Ming royal tomb in Henan Province. His Imperial Concubine Zhao's tomb is next to his. Most Ming tombs are near Beijing, except for the tomb of Hongwu in Nanjing. Dingling, the tomb of Duke Lu's brother, Emperor Wanli, is the only one open to the public in Beijing. Photos by Gary L.
