The first lecture of 28 on Chinese History from its origins to the present, given in 2007 by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of History at Sias International University, Xinzheng, Henan, China. This was our first attempt to make video recordings, and the presence of a camera proved somewhat intimidating. I felt like a zombie during the lectures, and the students all sat silently behind the camera, until after the camera was turned off. The best discussions all took place after the lectures.
